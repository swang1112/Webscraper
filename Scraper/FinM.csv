1,Mispriced index option portfolios,"George M. Constantinides, Michal Czerwonko, Stylianos Perrakis",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12288,"In model‐free out‐of‐sample tests, we find that the optimal portfolio of a utility maximizing investor trading in the S&P500 Index, cash, and index options bought at ask and written at bid prices stochastically dominates the optimal portfolio without options and yields returns with higher mean and lower volatility in most months from 1990 to 2013. Unlike earlier claims of overpriced puts, our portfolios include mostly short calls and are particularly profitable when maturity is short and volatility is high. Similar results are obtained with the CAC and DAX indices. Neither priced factors nor a nonmonotonic stochastic discount factor explains the excess returns."
2,Crowdfunding models: Keep‐It‐All vs. All‐Or‐Nothing,"Douglas J. Cumming, Gaël Leboeuf, Armin Schwienbacher",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12262,"Reward‐based crowdfunding campaigns are commonly offered in one of two models via fundraising goals set by an entrepreneur: “Keep‐It‐All” (KIA), where the entrepreneur keeps the entire amount raised regardless of achieving the goal, and “All‐Or‐Nothing” (AON), where the entrepreneur keeps nothing unless the goal is achieved. We hypothesize that AON forces the entrepreneur to bear greater risk and encourages crowdfunders to pledge more capital enabling entrepreneurs to set larger goals. We further hypothesize that AON is a costly signal of commitment for entrepreneurs yielding a separate equilibrium with higher quality and more innovative projects with greater success rates. Empirical tests support both hypotheses."
3,Director attention and firm value,"Rex Wang Renjie, Patrick Verwijmeren",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12259,"In this article, we show that exogenous director distraction affects board monitoring intensity and leads to a higher level of inactivity by management. We construct a firm‐level director “distraction” measure by exploiting shocks to unrelated industries in which directors have additional directorships. Directors attend significantly fewer board meetings when they are distracted. Firms with distracted board members tend to be inactive and experience a significant decline in firm value. Overall, this article highlights the impact of limited director attention on the effectiveness of corporate governance and the importance of directors in keeping management active."
4,Director overconfidence,"Randy Beavers, Shawn Mobbs",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12268,"We examine overconfident chief executive officer (CEO) directors and find they attend more board meetings, are more likely to serve on the nominating or the compensation committee, have more independent directorships, and foster higher attendance rates on boards. Boards with overconfident directors are more likely to appoint a better prepared and more reputable CEO following a turnover. These newly appointed CEOs are also more likely to be overconfident. This evidence indicates overconfident CEO directors exhibit significant influence on the board and over the firm's CEO selection."
5,A project‐level analysis of value creation in firms,"Jonathan B. Cohn, Umit G. Gurun, Rabih Moussawi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12249,"This paper analyzes value creation in firms at the project level. We present evidence that managers facing short‐termist incentives set a lower threshold for accepting projects. Using novel data on new client and product announcements in both the U.S. and international markets, we find that the market responds less positively to a new project announcement when the firm's managers have incentives to focus on short‐term stock price performance. Furthermore, textual analysis of project announcements shows that firms with short‐termist chief executive officers use vaguer and generically positive language when introducing new projects to the marketplace."
6,Local religious beliefs and municipal bond market outcomes,Alex Annan Abakah,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12271,"This study investigates whether religion‐induced risk aversion affects municipal bond market outcomes from 1990 to 2017. The results indicate that local government bonds issued from U.S. counties with a high Catholic‐to‐Protestant population ratio have lower credit risk ratings and lower yield spreads, and are less likely to have credit enhancement. The results stand up to additional tests. I control for issuer's county political party affiliation and state term limits, and continue to find significant effects. The effects are not driven by the issuer's county fiscal policies. Furthermore, the effects persist when I use an alternate specification that controls for omitted factors that are time invariant. Overall, my evidence suggests that a bond issuer's religion‐induced risk aversion plays a significant role in the pricing of local government bonds."
7,Bank capital buffers in a dynamic model,"Jochen Mankart, Alexander Michaelides, Spyros Pagratis",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12253,"We estimate a dynamic structural banking model to examine the interaction between risk‐weighted capital adequacy and unweighted leverage requirements, their differential impact on bank lending, and equity buffer accumulation in excess of regulatory minima. Tighter risk‐weighted capital requirements reduce loan supplies and lead to an endogenous fall in bank profitability, reducing bank incentives to accumulate equity buffers and, therefore, increasing the incidence of bank failure. Alternatively, tighter leverage requirements increase lending, preserve bank charter value, and incentives to accumulate equity buffers leading to lower bank failure rates."
8,Cybersecurity breaches and cash holdings: Spillover effect,Priya Garg,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12274,"This paper shows that firms significantly increase cash holdings after they have experienced a cybersecurity attack, and this behavior persists for years. A cyberattack increases cash holdings from a base level of 23% of assets to 26.87%. Similar firms, defined by industry and geographical proximity also increase their cash holdings. Suppliers of attacked firms are also affected. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the detrimental effects of a cybersecurity breach are not isolated to the attacked firms, and peer firms are quick to follow in taking precaution."
9,The effects of rural–urban migration on corporate innovation: Evidence from a natural experiment in China,"Deqiu Chen, Huasheng Gao, Jiang Luo, Yujing Ma",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12280,"We show that the migration of low‐skilled, rural workers to urban centers has a negative causal effect on innovation of firms in such urban centers. Our tests exploit the staggered relaxation of city‐level household registration system in China, which facilitates rural residents to migrate to cities. We find a significant decrease in innovation for firms headquartered in cities that have adopted such policies relative to firms headquartered in cities that have not. Overall, our results support the view that an abundant supply of low‐skilled workers increases the benefit of using existing low‐skilled technology and thus reduces firms’ incentive to innovate."
10,"Within‐syndicate conflicts, loan covenants, and syndicate formation","Nishant Dass, Vikram Nanda, Qinghai Wang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12270,"We study how conflicts within a lending syndicate affect loan contract and syndicate formation. We argue that loan provisions serve an important dual function: In addition to moderating borrower–lender conflicts, they reduce within‐syndicate conflicts. We show that greater potential for within‐syndicate conflicts is associated with more and stricter covenants. Loans are less restrictive when the interests of participants and the lead arrangers are better aligned, for example, when participant–banks have stronger relationships with the lead arranger or hold borrower's equity (indirectly). Overall, our results show that covenant choice, syndicate formation, and lead arranger's loan allocation all play an important role in reducing within‐syndicate conflicts."

13,The investment behavior of buyout funds: Theory and evidence,"Alexander Ljungqvist, Matthew Richardson, Daniel Wolfenzon",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12264,"We analyze the determinants of buyout funds’ investment decisions. We argue that when there is imperfect competition for private equity funds, the timing of funds’ investment decisions, their risk‐taking behavior, and their subsequent returns depend on changes in the demand for private equity, conditions in the credit market, and fund managers’ ability to influence perceptions of their talent. We investigate these hypotheses using a proprietary dataset of 207 U.S. buyout funds that invested in 1,957 buyout targets over a 30‐year period. Our dataset contains precisely dated cash inflows and outflows in every portfolio company, links every buyout target to an identifiable buyout fund, and is free from reporting and survivor biases. Thus, we are able to characterize every buyout fund's precise investment choices. Our findings are as follows. First, established funds accelerate their investment flows and earn higher returns when investment opportunities improve, competition for deal flow eases, and credit market conditions loosen. Second, the investment behavior of first‐time funds is less sensitive to market conditions. Third, younger funds invest in riskier buyouts, in an effort to establish a track record. Finally, following periods of good performance, funds become more conservative, and this effect is stronger for first‐time funds."
14,Order anticipation around predictable trades,Mehmet Sağlam,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12255,I study the presence of order anticipation strategies by examining predictable patterns in large order trades. I construct three simple signals based on child‐order execution patterns and find empirical evidence that stronger signals are correlated with higher execution costs. I use the SEC's (Securities and Exchange Commission's) ban on unfiltered access and increase in noise trading as shocks to order anticipatory activities of algorithmic traders and find that the price impact of predictability is smaller when order anticipation becomes difficult. The empirical findings are mostly consistent with the back‐running theory that predicts delayed price impact as strategic traders learn about large orders gradually.
15,Endogenous debt maturity and rollover risk,"Emanuele Brancati, Marco Macchiavelli",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12250,"We empirically study the nature of rollover risk and show how banks manage it. Having to roll over debt does not lead to higher default risk per se. Only banks that lose significant access to new funding while having to roll over debt display higher default risk. We identify a factor that determines this buildup of risk: specifically, debt maturity shortening (forcing debt to be more frequently rolled over) and reduced access to new funding are both driven by market pessimism about banks’ future performance. We also provide evidence consistent with dynamic coordination risk."
16,The Benefits of Overvaluation: Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions,Evangelos Vagenas‐Nanos,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12247,"Theoretical and empirical evidence debates whether acquirers can exploit their overvalued equity and create value by purchasing less overvalued or undervalued target firms. Shleifer and Vishny (2003) and Savor and Lu (2009) argue in favor of this, while Fu, Lin, and Officer (2013) and Akbulut (2013) provide evidence against. I revisit this issue and develop a quasi‐experimental design. The misvaluation effect for stock acquirers that are more overvalued than their targets is isolated and measured. My findings offer direct evidence in favor of the Shleifer and Vishny (2003) market‐timing hypothesis."
17,"Fund selection, style allocation, and active management abilities: Evidence from funds of hedge funds’ holdings","Chao Gao, Timothy D. Haight, Chengdong Yin",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12258,"This study examines whether funds of hedge funds (FOHFs) provide superior before‐fee performance through managers’ fund selection, style allocation, and active management abilities. Using reported holdings of Securities and Exchange Commission–registered FOHFs, we find that FOHF managers have fund selection abilities, as hedge funds held by FOHFs outperform their style indices and over half of the individual hedge funds in the Lipper Trading Advisor Selection System (TASS) database. We also find that FOHF managers add value through active management of FOHFs’ holdings, while evidence on their style allocation abilities is mixed. Our findings suggest that FOHFs generate superior before‐fee performance and that FOHF managers’ skillset is broader than previously documented. Thus, our study helps explain why FOHFs continue to survive and suggests that FOHF fee structure reform merits consideration."
18,Foreign market portfolio concentration and performance,Sturla Lyngnes Fjesme,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12263,"Using security holdings of 49,857 foreign investors on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE), I test whether concentrated investment strategies in international markets result in excess risk‐adjusted returns. I find that investors with higher learning capacity increase returns, while investors with lower learning capacity decrease returns from the portfolio concentration. I measure learning capacity as institutional classification, geographical proximity to Norway, and cultural closeness to Norwegian investors (as based on the Hofstede cultural closeness measures). I conclude, consistent with the information advantage theory, that concentrated investment strategies in foreign markets can be optimal (disastrous) for investors with higher (lower) learning capacity."
19,Vertical integration as an input price hedge: The case of Delta Air Lines and trainer refinery,"Abdullah Mohammed Almansur, William L. Megginson, Leonid V. Pugachev",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12260,"In April 2012, Delta Air Lines (Delta) purchased a mothballed oil refinery. We use this case to illustrate when, how, and why vertical integration (VI) can hedge input price risk. First, we show that stockholders and creditors expected the move to create wealth. Consistent with their predictions, Delta's exposure to refining margins, cash flow volatility, cost of debt, and default probability all decreased, relative to peers, postacquisition. Our evidence is consistent with the refinery influencing Delta's operating strategies, especially in its most affected markets. The case demonstrates how asset specificity and financial hedging frictions can justify VI."
20,Price discovery and persistent arbitrage violations in credit markets,"Hai Lin, Kasing Man, Junbo Wang, Chunchi Wu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12261,"This paper investigates price violations in credit markets using a data sample spanning from 2002 to 2016. We find that price violations are highly persistent during the crisis period, particularly for speculative‐grade bonds. There is evidence that price distortions and market disintegration are linked to market‐wide and firm‐level impediments to arbitrage and limited capital provision. Higher firm‐level impediments to arbitrage lead to less market integration, and more severe and persistent pricing discrepancies. Moreover, we find that the negative CDS basis persists in the postcrisis period, which is attributable to dealers’ lower capital commitment and deterioration in market‐making quality."
21,Corporate Governance and Financial Peer Effects,"Douglas (DJ) Fairhurst, Yoonsoo Nam",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12240,"Growing evidence suggests that managers select financial policies partially by mimicking policies of peer firms. We find that these peer effects in capital structure choice are unique to firms operating under weak external corporate governance. Cross‐sectional tests suggest that this finding is best explained by a quiet life hypothesis in which managers may be able to avoid the effort required to optimize financial policies and the scrutiny of market participants. Leverage ratios of mimicking firms display less sensitivity to a profitability shock. Finally, mimicking correlates to higher financing costs and lower future profitability, especially if it results in high leverage."
22,Required return on equity when capital structure is dynamic,"Na Dai, Louis R. Piccotti",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fima.12266,"We link the firm's required return on equity to its target debt ratio. We find that a firm's expected return on equity is increasing in the product of the distance between its debt ratio and its target debt ratio, its speed of adjustment, and the spread of the tax benefits of its debt over its bankruptcy costs of debt. Our empirical tests validate the testable implications of our model."
