1,Firms’ Management of Infrequent Shocks,"BENJAMIN L. COLLIER, ANDREW F. HAUGHWOUT, HOWARD C. KUNREUTHER, ERWANN O. MICHEL‐KERJAN",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12674,"We examine businesses’ financial management of a rare, severe event using detailed firm‐level data collected following Hurricane Sandy in the New York area. Credit played a prominent role in financing recovery; more negatively affected firms took on debt because of Sandy (39%) than received insurance payments (15%) in our data. Negatively affected firms were frequently credit constrained after the shock. We also find that the most credit‐constrained firms after the event, younger firms, and smaller firms, were the least likely to insure before it. Our findings align with the predictions of dynamic risk management theory (Rampini and Viswanathan 2010, 2013)."
2,The Euro Area Bond Free Float and the Implications for QE,"TOBIAS S. BLATTNER, MICHAEL A. S. JOYCE",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12685,"This paper examines how shocks to government bond duration risk held by price‐sensitive investors affect the euro area term structure of interest rates and the wider macroeconomy. We construct a new measure of the bond “free float,” which adjusts total debt for foreign official holdings and weights by residual maturity. Using a small macrofinance Bayesian Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we estimate that the first round of asset purchases under the European Central Bank's (ECB) public sector purchase program reduced euro area 10‐year bond yields by around 30 bps in 2015. The positive impact on the output gap and inflation in 2016 was about 0.2 and 0.3 ppt, respectively."
3,A Liquidity‐Based Resolution of the Uncovered Interest Parity Puzzle,"SEUNGDUCK LEE, KUK MO JUNG",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12663,A new monetary theory is set out to resolve the “uncovered interest parity (UIP)” puzzle. It explores the possibility that liquidity properties of money and nominal bonds can account for the puzzle. A key concept in our model is that nominal bonds carry liquidity premia. We show that the UIP can fail to hold under the economic environment where collateral pledgeability and/or liquidity of nominal bonds and/or collateralized credit‐based transactions are relatively bigger. Our liquidity‐based theory can help understanding many empirical observations that risk‐based explanations find difficult to reconcile with.
4,"Money, Asset Prices, and the Liquidity Premium",SEUNGDUCK LEE,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12637,"This paper examines the effect of monetary policy on the market value of the liquidity services that financial assets provide, known as the liquidity premium. The theory predicts that money supply and nominal interest rates have positive effects on the liquidity premium, but asset supply has a negative effect. The empirical analysis with U.S. data confirms the theoretical predictions. The theory also proposes that the liquidity properties of assets can cause negative nominal yields when the money holding cost is low and liquid assets are scarce. The suggestive empirical findings in Switzerland to support this theoretical result are presented."
5,Flow Effects of Central Bank Asset Purchases on Sovereign Bond Prices: Evidence from a Natural Experiment,"ROBERTO A. DE SANTIS, FÉDÉRIC HOLM‐HADULLA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12665,"We estimate the response of sovereign bond prices to net supply shocks caused by purchase operations under the ECB's Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP). To avoid simultaneity bias in the estimated relationship between prices and purchases, we exploit a PSPP feature that renders securities temporarily ineligible for reasons unrelated to their prices. Using these purchase restrictions as an instrument to identify exogenous variation in purchase volumes, we find that PSPP causes statistically significant and economically relevant upward price impacts. The impacts are short‐lived and concentrated in securities issued by higher yield jurisdictions and characterized by higher maturity and lower liquidity."
6,Harmful Procompetitive Effects of Trade in Presence of Credit Market Frictions,"RETO FOELLMI, MANUEL OECHSLIN",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12634,"We explore the consequences of international trade in an economy that encompasses technology choice and an endogenous distribution of mark‐ups due to credit market frictions. We show that in such an environment a gradual opening of trade may—but not necessarily must—have a negative impact on productivity and overall output. The reason is that the procompetitive effects of trade reduce mark‐ups and hence make access to credit more difficult for smaller firms. As a result, smaller firms—while not driven out of the market—may be forced to switch to less productive technologies."
7,Fiscal Policy and Occupational Employment Dynamics,"CHRISTIAN BREDEMEIER, FALKO JUESSEN, ROLAND WINKLER",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12627,"We document substantial heterogeneity in occupational employment dynamics in response to government spending shocks in the United States. Employment rises most strongly in service, sales, and office (“pink‐collar”) occupations. By contrast, employment in blue‐collar occupations is hardly affected by fiscal policy. We provide evidence that occupation‐specific changes in labor demand are key for understanding these findings. We develop a business‐cycle model that explains the heterogeneous occupational employment dynamics as a consequence of composition effects due to heterogeneous employment changes across industries and occupation‐specific within‐industry employment shifts due to differences in the short‐run substitutability between labor and capital services across occupations."
8,Macroprudential Policies in a Low Interest Rate Environment,"MARGARITA RUBIO, FANG YAO",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12662,"In this paper, we analyze the use of macroprudential policies in a low interest rate environment, where an occasionally binding zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint gives rise to aggregate demand externalities. We study this issue by using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with financial frictions and a monetary policy rule that is subject to the ZLB. We find that, in a low interest rate environment, the occasionally binding ZLB creates additional scope for macroprudential intervention. When the interest rate is high and the two policies can perfectly coordinate, the optimal policy prescriptions behave as if they were independent. This is, however, no more the case, when the interest rate is low and/or when monetary policy and macroprudential policy cannot be perfectly coordinating. This more complex policy environment calls for more policy coordination."
9,Nonlinear Effects of Mortgage Spreads Over the Business Cycle,"CHAK HUNG JACK CHENG, CHING‐WAI (JEREMY) CHIU",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12635,"This paper provides robust evidence for the nonlinear effects of mortgage spread shocks during recessions and expansions in the United States. Estimating a smooth‐transition vector autoregression (STVAR) model, we show that mortgage spread shocks hitting in a recessionary phase create significantly deeper and more protracted declines in consumption and housing market variables. In addition, we provide evidence that these mortgage spread shocks could be largely interpreted as credit supply shocks in the mortgage market. Our empirical results imply that unconventional monetary policy, such as the Federal Reserve's mortgage‐backed security purchase program, would be a more effective tool for stabilizing the economy during recessions than in expansions."

12,The Dynamics of Capital Flow Episodes,"CHRISTIAN FRIEDRICH, PIERRE GUÉRIN",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12614,"We first propose a novel methodology for identifying episodes of strong equity and bond flows using estimates from a regime‐switching model that keeps context‐ and sample‐specific assumptions to a minimum. We then assess the impacts of U.S. stock market volatility (VIX) and U.S. monetary policy shocks on equity and bond flow episodes. Our results indicate that the impacts of both shocks differ across in‐ and outflow episodes and, based on an assessment of equity flows, vary considerably over time. While VIX shocks are mostly associated with asymmetric impacts across episodes, U.S. monetary policy shocks generate such asymmetries primarily over time."
13,Debt and Financial Vulnerability on the Verge of Retirement,"ANNAMARIA LUSARDI, OLIVIA S. MITCHELL, NOEMI OGGERO",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12671,"We analyze older individuals’ debt and financial vulnerability using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). In the HRS, we compare three groups of people age 56–61 in 1992, 2004, and 2010, to assess cross‐cohort changes in debt over time. Two waves of the NFCS (2012 and 2015) provide additional insights into debt management and older individuals’ capacity to shield themselves against shocks. We conclude that recent cohorts hold more debt and face more financial insecurity than in the past. This will render them particularly vulnerable to forecasted interest rate increases."
14,Cultural Determinants of Household Saving Behavior,"NICOLA FUCHS‐SCHÜNDELN, PAOLO MASELLA, HANNAH PAULE‐PALUDKIEWICZ",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12659,"Relying on the epidemiological approach, we show that culture is a significant driver of household saving behavior. Second‐generation immigrants from countries that put strong emphasis on thrift or wealth accumulation tend to save more in Germany. We confirm these results in data from the United Kingdom. By linking parents to their children, we show that these two cultural components affect the saving behavior of both first‐generation immigrants and their children."
15,On the Relationship between Domestic Saving and the Current Account: Evidence and Theory for Developing Countries,"MARKUS BRUECKNER, WOJTEK PACZOS, EVI PAPPA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12658,"We examine the relationship between domestic saving and the current account in developing countries. Our three main findings are that: (i) domestic saving has a small effect on the current account; (ii) domestic saving has a significant positive effect on the trade balance—this effect is much larger than the effect that domestic saving has on the current account; and (iii) domestic saving has a significant negative effect on net‐current transfers. We use countries in the SSA region during the period 1980‐2009 as a laboratory for an instrumental variables (IV) approach. The IV approach enables to obtain estimates of causal effects. Underlying the IV approach is the significant positive first‐stage response of domestic saving to plausibly exogenous annual rainfall: an unanticipated, transitory supply‐side shock. We construct a small open‐economy DSGE model with debt adjustment costs and endogenous current transfers to match the empirical findings. The model enables to examine the relationship between domestic saving and the current account for different types of shocks. An important message of our paper is that, for developing countries, estimates of the relationship between domestic saving and domestic investment are not informative for answering the question how domestic saving affects a country's accumulation of net foreign assets."
16,A Welfare‐Based Analysis of International Monetary Policy Spillovers at the Zero Lower Bound,"ALEX HABERIS, ANNA LIPIŃSKA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12655,"We study the welfare effects of international monetary policy spillovers at the zero lower bound, focusing on the effects of forward guidance in a large economy (“foreign”) on its smaller trading partner (“home”) in scenarios motivated by the global financial crisis. We find that foreign forward guidance has an overall prosper‐thy‐neighbor effect on the home economy as long as it increases foreign welfare. This finding holds under alternative assumptions about exchange rate pass‐through or the degree of international financial integration. However, foreign forward guidance may worsen the trade‐off between the stabilization objectives of home monetary policy."
17,Endogenous Growth and Real Effects of Monetary Policy: R&D and Physical Capital Complementarities,"PEDRO MAZEDA GIL, GUSTAVO IGLÉSIAS",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12632,"We study the real long‐run effects of the structural stance of monetary policy and of inflation, in the context of a monetary growth model where R&D is complemented with physical capital accumulation. We look into the effects on a set of real macroeconomic variables that have been of interest to policymakers—the economic growth rate, real interest rate, physical investment rate, capital‐to‐labor ratio, R&D intensity, and velocity of money. These variables have been previously analyzed from the perspective of different, separated, strands of the theoretical and empirical literature. Additionally, we analyze the long‐run relationship between inflation and both the effectiveness of real industrial‐policy shocks and the market structure, assessed namely by average firm size. We present novel cross‐country evidence on the empirical relationship between the latter and long‐run inflation."
18,Trade Credit Use as Firms Approach Default,"EMILIA GARCIA‐APPENDINI, JUDIT MONTORIOL‐GARRIGA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12618,"Using a sample of distressed firms with information about suppliers, we document an average fall in the use of trade credit as firms approach bankruptcy compared to a control sample of nonbankrupt firms. However, we uncover a large degree of heterogeneity across suppliers. Suppliers facing high switching costs maintain their business ties with the distressed firms as they approach bankruptcy, and provide them more trade credit. Suppliers in concentrated markets provide temporary support to their clients. Overall, the findings of this paper suggest that switching costs are fundamental to explain whether suppliers provide liquidity to their distressed clients or not."
19,On the Effectiveness of Loan‐to‐Value Regulation in a Multiconstraint Framework,ANNA GRODECKA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12623,"Models in the infinite horizon macro‐housing literature often assume that borrowers are constrained exclusively by the loan‐to‐value (LTV) ratio. Motivated by the Swedish microdata, I explore an alternative arrangement where borrowers are constrained by a collateral constraint and by a debt‐service‐to‐income ratio. While stricter LTV limits are often considered as a measure to tackle the rise in household indebtedness, I find that policy designed to lower the maximum permissible LTV ratio may actually leave the debt‐to‐GDP ratio unchanged and increase housing prices in equilibrium if borrowers are bound by two constraints at the same time."
20,How Unsecured Credit Policies Influence Mortgage and Unsecured Loan Defaults,JISEOB KIM,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12620,"Before the global financial crisis, the proportion of households defaulting on the mortgage while remaining current on the unsecured loan was almost the same as the proportion of households current on the mortgage but defaulting on the unsecured loan. After the crisis, the former ratio became higher than the latter. By using a heterogeneous agent model with the mortgage and the unsecured loan, I examine how the order of defaults changed before and after the crisis. I then analyze the impacts of unsecured credit policies on households' mortgage and unsecured loan defaults. My quantitative exercise shows that both default rates can decrease as the cost for unsecured loan defaults increases."
21,Do Stronger Patents Stimulate or Stifle Innovation? The Crucial Role of Financial Development,"ANGUS C. CHU, GUIDO COZZI, HAICHAO FAN, SHIYUAN PAN, MENGBO ZHANG",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12629,"This study explores the effects of patent protection in a research and development (R&D)‐based growth model with financial frictions. We find that whether stronger patent protection stimulates or stifles innovation depends on credit constraints faced by R&D entrepreneurs. When credit constraints are nonbinding (binding), strengthening patent protection stimulates (stifles) R&D. The overall effect of patent protection on innovation follows an inverted‐U pattern. By relaxing the credit constraints, financial development stimulates innovation. Furthermore, patent protection is more likely to have a positive effect on innovation under a higher level of financial development. We consider cross‐country panel regressions and find supportive evidence for this result."

24,Monetary Equilibrium and the Cost of Banking Activity,"PAOLA BOEL, GABRIELE CAMERA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12676,"We investigate the effects of banks' operating costs on allocations and welfare in a low interest rate environment. We introduce an explicit production function for banks in a microfounded model where banks employ labor resources, hired on a competitive market, to run their operations. In equilibrium, this generates a spread between interest rates on loans and deposits, which reflects the underlying monetary policy and the efficiency of financial intermediation. In a deflation or low‐inflation environment, equilibrium deposits yield zero returns. Hence, banks soak up labor resources to offer deposits that do not outperform idle balances, thus reducing aggregate efficiency."
25,"Banks' Funding Stress, Lending Supply, and Consumption Expenditure","H. EVREN DAMAR, REINT GROPP, ADI MORDEL",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12673,"We employ a unique identification strategy linking survey data on household consumption expenditure to bank‐level data to estimate the effects of bank funding stress on consumer credit and consumption expenditures. We show that households whose banks were more exposed to funding shocks report lower levels of nonmortgage liabilities. This, however, only translates into lower levels of consumption for low‐income households. Hence, adverse credit supply shocks are associated with significant heterogeneous effects."
26,Inflation‐Indexed Bonds and Nominal Bonds: Financial Innovation and Precautionary Motives,MINWOOK KANG,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12609,This paper introduces a two‐period monetary general equilibrium model with proportional transaction costs on nominal and inflation‐indexed bonds. This paper demonstrates that financial innovation on indexed bonds causes equilibrium interest rates of the nominal bond to increase when agents have precautionary saving motives. This result implies that ignoring precautionary motives would underestimate savers' welfare gain and overestimate borrowers' welfare gain from innovation on indexed bonds.
27,The Effects of State‐Mandated Financial Education on College Financing Behaviors,"CHRISTIANA STODDARD, CARLY URBAN",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12624,"Students entering college have limited financial experience while making complex borrowing decisions. This paper examines a policy lever that may improve these decisions: high school personal finance graduation requirements. We use a difference‐in‐difference strategy to determine their effects on financial aid decisions of incoming freshmen at 4‐year institutions. Our results suggest financial education shifts students from high‐cost to low‐cost financing. The requirements increase aid applications and acceptance of federal loans, while decreasing the likelihood of holding credit card balances. Students from less affluent family backgrounds reduce their likelihoods of working and borrowers from more affluent backgrounds reduce private loan amounts."
28,Labor Market and Financial Shocks: A Time‐Varying Analysis,"FRANCESCO CORSELLO, VALERIO NISPI LANDI",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12638,"We estimate a time‐varying VAR model to analyze the effects of a financial shock on the U.S. labor market. We find that a tightening of financial conditions is highly detrimental to the labor market. We show that while negative financial shocks have been responsible for increases in unemployment, our model does not find significant contributions of financial shocks during periods of expansion. The source of this asymmetry is the time‐varying standard deviation of the identified shock, which is higher in times of financial distress; on the other hand, we find that the transmission mechanism does not significantly change over time."
29,Monetary Policy Uncertainty and the Response of the Yield Curve to Policy Shocks,PETER TILLMANN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12657,"This paper studies the nonlinear response of the term structure of interest rates to monetary policy shocks and presents a new stylized fact. We show that uncertainty about monetary policy changes the way the term structure responds to monetary policy. A policy tightening leads to a significantly smaller increase in long‐term bond yields if policy uncertainty is high at the time of the shock. We also look at the decomposition of bond yields into expectations about future policy and the term premium. The weaker response of yields is driven by the fall in term premia, which fall more strongly if uncertainty about policy is high. Conditional on a monetary policy shock, higher uncertainty about monetary policy tends to make securities with longer maturities relatively more attractive to investors. As a consequence, investors demand even lower term premia. These findings are robust to the measurement of monetary policy uncertainty, the definition of the monetary policy shock, and to changing the model specification."
30,On the Value of Virtual Currencies,"WILKO BOLT, MAARTEN R.C. VAN OORDT",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12619,"Our economic framework suggests that the exchange rate of virtual currency is determined by three components. First, the current value of transactions in virtual currency which absorb part of the exchange rate risk. Second, the decisions and expectations of forward‐looking investors to buy virtual currency (thereby effectively regulating its supply). Third, the elements that jointly drive future consumer adoption and merchant acceptance of virtual currency. The model predicts that, as virtual currency becomes more established, the exchange rate will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators' beliefs. This undermines the notion that excessive exchange rate volatility will prohibit widespread use of virtual currency."
31,Foreign Direct Investment and Debt Financing in Emerging Economies,"PAUL LUK, TIANXIAO ZHENG",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12612,"The rich dynamics of capital flows is an important characteristic of business cycles in emerging market economies. In the data external debt is always procyclical, while FDI is procyclical only in normal times. We provide a microfounded rationale for this pattern by linking financial shocks to capital flows. For this purpose, we build a small open economy model in which firms are subject to borrowing constraints, and are either owned domestically or by foreign investors who purchase firms through FDI. During a financial crisis, the valuation gap per unit net worth between foreign and domestic investors widens, which triggers more FDI inflow. Our model produces business cycle moments consistent with empirical observations."
32,"Tax Evasion, Investment Shocks, and the Consumption Puzzle: A DSGE Analysis with Financial Frictions","BRUNO CHIARINI, MARIA FERRARA, ELISABETTA MARZANO",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12616,"Recent studies identify Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI) shocks as important drivers of the business cycle. However, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models struggle to explain macroeconomic comovements between consumption and the key real variables after a MEI shock. Moreover, engaging in tax evasion practices is often an answer to financial constraints, which have been recognized as important determinants of cyclical fluctuations as well. We use a medium‐scale New Keynesian DSGE model, that combines tax evasion with financial frictions, to simulate a MEI shock. We show that entrepreneurial tax evasion can solve the comovement problem to a fair extent."
33,Can Stock Volatility Be Benign? New Measurements and Macroeconomic Implications,"YU‐FAN HUANG, SUI LUO",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12626,"We find nonsynchronized movements of two new measures of financial market uncertainty—good and bad volatility—which are based on the maximum and minimum stock prices within a month. Good (bad) volatility is associated with better (worse) expectations about the future economic situation and clearly signals acceleration (deceleration) in economic activity. The VAR results indicate that (i) output, employment, and stock price plummet rapidly in response to a bad volatility shock, while their responses to a good volatility shock are modest, and (ii) bad volatility shocks explain the bulk of economic activity and stock price fluctuations in the medium run."
34,A Note of Caution on Shadow Rate Estimates,LEO KRIPPNER,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12613,"Shadow short rate (SSR) estimates are generated regressors proposed as a proxy for policy interest rates during unconventional monetary policy (UMP) periods. However, using the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow/lower‐bound model, I show that SSR estimates can be sensitive to minor choices in their estimation. Used subsequently in a small macroeconomic model, those sensitivities lead to wide variations in the inferred effects of UMP on inflation and unemployment outcomes. Therefore, it should not be presumed that any SSR series will necessarily be quantitatively useful. Vetting SSR series allows appropriate SSR series to be retained within the suite of UMP indicators."

37,Identifying Price Reviews by Firms: An Econometric Approach,"MARK N. HARRIS, HERVÉ LE BIHAN, PATRICK SEVESTRE",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12675,"Price reviews are a potentially costly activity. A significant fraction of unchanged prices may stem from firms not reviewing prices, rather than from obstacles to changing prices per se, such as menu costs. In this paper, we disentangle these two causes of price stickiness by estimating an inflated ordered probit model on a panel of French manufacturing firms. The results point to a low frequency of price reviews, suggestive of the relevance of information costs as a determinant of the observed price stickiness. In view of the “inattentive producers” literature, pointing that the source of price rigidity matters, this is suggestive of a large real effect of monetary policy."
38,Official Demand for U.S. Debt: Implications for U.S. Real Rates,"IRYNA KAMINSKA, GABRIELE ZINNA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12660,"We estimate a structural term‐structure model of U.S. real rates, where arbitrageurs accommodate demand pressures exerted by domestic and foreign official investors. Official demand affects rates by altering the aggregate price of duration risk, and thereby bond risk premiums. Although foreign central banks' demand contributed to reduce long‐term real rates mainly in the years prior to the global‐financial crisis, the Federal Reserve's demand lowered rates during the quantitative easing period. Overall, the two‐factor model, augmented to account for changing liquidity conditions, offers a good representation of real rates during the 2001–16 period; however, we flag some caveats and possible extensions."
39,(In)Efficient Interbank Networks,"FABIO CASTIGLIONESI, NOEMI NAVARRO",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12664,"We study the efficiency properties of the formation of an interbank network. Banks face a trade‐off by establishing connections in the interbank market. On the one hand, banks improve the diversification of their liquidity risk and therefore can obtain a higher expected payoff. On the other hand, banks not sufficiently capitalized have risk‐shifting incentives that expose them to the risk of bankruptcy. Connecting to such risky banks negatively affects expected payoff. We show that both the optimal and the decentralized networks are characterized by a core‐periphery structure. The core is made of the safe banks, whereas the periphery is populated by the risky banks. Nevertheless, the two network structures coincide only if counterparty risk is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the decentralized network is underconnected as compared to the optimal one. Finally, we analyze mechanisms that can avoid the formation of inefficient interbank networks."
40,Monetary Policy Transmission with Interbank Market Fragmentation,MIKLOS VARI,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12604,"This paper shows how interbank market fragmentation disrupts the transmission of monetary policy. Fragmentation is the fact that banks, depending on their country of location, have different probabilities of default on their interbank borrowings. Once fragmentation is introduced into standard theoretical models of monetary policy implementation, excess liquidity arises endogenously. This leads short‐term interest rates to depart from the central bank policy rates. Using data on monetary policy operations, I show that this mechanism has been at work in the euro area since 2008. The model is used to analyze conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures."
41,Monetary Policy Implementation in a Negative Rate Environment,"MICHAEL BOUTROS, JONATHAN WITMER",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12605,"To analyze monetary policy implementation in a negative rate environment, we add the option to exchange central bank reserves for cash to the standard workhorse model of monetary policy implementation (Poole 1968). Importantly, we show that monetary policy can be constrained when the target overnight rate is below the yield on cash. At this point, the overnight rate equals the yield on cash instead of the target rate. Modifications to the implementation framework, such as a reserve requirement that varies with cash withdrawals, can help restore the implementation of monetary policy such that the overnight rate equals the target rate."
42,Elections and Capital Flows,ADAM HONIG,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12599,"This paper investigates the extent to which elections affect capital flows. I find little evidence of political capital flow cycles in advanced economies. In emerging and developing countries, however, presidential elections significantly lower preelection foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows but have no effect on other types of capital flows. Furthermore, I find evidence that these cycles are not caused by economic crises related to elections or preelection manipulation of policy variables. These results suggest that uncertainty about future government policies, which should have greater impact on more irreversible forms of capital flows like FDI, may be an important factor in generating this cycle."
43,The Effectiveness of Consumption Taxes and Transfers as Insurance Against Idiosyncratic Risk,"TOMOYUKI NAKAJIMA, SHUHEI TAKAHASHI",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12597,"We quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of a consumption tax and lump‐sum transfer program as insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. We use a heterogeneous agent, incomplete markets model in which households adjust savings and employment in each period in the presence of idiosyncratic productivity risk and a borrowing constraint. The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy. We find a weak insurance effect of the consumption tax and transfer program. Expanding the tax and transfer program from the current U.S. level increases the capital‐output ratio and reduces the interest rate. Consumption inequality also decreases only slightly."
44,Mad about Austerity? The Effect of Fiscal Consolidation on Public Opinion,"ANNA KALBHENN, LIVIO STRACCA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12687,"We explore the impact of fiscal austerity on three different dimensions of public opinion in 26 European Union countries (consumer confidence, attitude toward national authorities, and European institutions) on annual data between 1997 and 2017. Our main finding is that the independent effect of a tighter fiscal stance on public opinion is not large and, when present, seems to closely follow the impact of fiscal austerity on economic activity. Our results therefore are inconsistent with the view that fiscal austerity necessarily implies a negative effect on public opinion and a decline in popularity of national and European institutions."
45,Credit Crunches from Occasionally Binding Bank Borrowing Constraints,"TOM D. HOLDEN, PAUL LEVINE, JONATHAN M. SWARBRICK",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12601,"We present a model in which banks and other financial intermediaries face both occasionally binding borrowing constraints, and costs of equity issuance. Near the steady state, these intermediaries can raise equity finance at no cost through retained earnings. However, even moderately large shocks cause their borrowing constraints to bind, leading to contractions in credit offered to firms, and requiring the intermediaries to raise further funds by paying the cost to issue equity. This leads to the occasional sharp increases in interest spreads and the countercyclical, positively skewed equity issuance that are characteristics of the credit crunches observed in the data."
46,Voluntary Reserve Targets,"GARTH BAUGHMAN, FRANCESCA CARAPELLA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12579,"We study monetary policy implementation through an operating regime involving voluntary reserve targets (VRTs). Operating regimes based on reserve requirements may lead to a collapse in interbank trade, as they have since the financial crisis. We show that, no matter the abundance of reserves, VRTs encourage market activity and support the central bank's control over interest rates. We consider (i) the impact of anticipated and unanticipated liquidity injections by the central bank on market outcomes and (ii) a comparison with the implementation framework currently adopted by the Federal Reserve. Overall, a VRT framework may provide several advantages over other frameworks."
47,Financial Shocks and Corporate Investment in Emerging Markets,"DELONG LI, NICOLAS E. MAGUD, FABIAN VALENCIA",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12603,"We examine how cross‐firm and cross‐country heterogeneity shapes the responses of corporate investment in emerging markets to changes in U.S. monetary policy and financial‐market volatility, the latter proxying for uncertainty. We find that in response to increases in U.S monetary policy rates or financial‐market volatility, financially weaker firms reduce investment by more than financially strong firms. We also show that firms with stronger balance sheets delay investment voluntarily when faced with higher uncertainty. Finally, we find that stronger macroeconomic fundamentals (lower public debt or higher international reserves) help to buffer corporate investment from increases in U.S. monetary policy rates."

50,The Local Aggregate Effects of Minimum Wage Increases,"DANIEL COOPER, MARÍA JOSÉ LUENGO‐PRADO, JONATHAN A. PARKER",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12684,"Using variation in minimum wages across cities and controlling for differences in business‐cycle factors and long‐run local economic trends, we find that following minimum wage increases, both, prices and nominal spending rise modestly. These gains are larger for certain subcategories of goods such as food away from home and in locations where low‐wage workers account for a larger share of employment. Further, minimum wage increases are associated with reduced total debt among households with low credit scores, higher auto debt, and increased access to credit."
51,Nominal GDP Targeting with Heterogeneous Labor Supply,"JAMES BULLARD, AARTI SINGH",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12615,"We study nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting as optimal monetary policy in a model with a credit market friction following Azariadis et al. (2018), henceforth ABSS. We extend the ABSS framework to allow for heterogeneous labor supply. We show that nominal GDP targeting continues to characterize optimal monetary policy in this setting. We also analyze the incomplete markets equilibrium that exists when the monetary policymaker pursues a suboptimal policy, and show how an extension to more general preferences can limit the ability of the policymaker to provide full insurance to households in this setting."
52,Financial Dampening,"JOHANNES F. WIELAND, MU‐JEUNG YANG",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12681,"We propose a novel mechanism, “financial dampening,” whereby loan retrenchment by banks attenuates the effectiveness of monetary policy. The theory unifies an endogenous supply of illiquid local loans and risk sharing among subsidiaries of bank holding companies (BHCs). We derive an instrumental variable (IV) strategy that separates supply‐driven loan retrenchment from local loan demand by exploiting linkages through BHC internal capital markets across spatially separate BHC member banks. We estimate that retrenching banks increase loan supply substantially less in response to exogenous monetary policy rate reductions. This relative decline has persistent effects on local employment and thus provides a rationale for slow recoveries from financial distress."
53,U.S. Banking Sector Operational Losses and the Macroeconomic Environment,"AZAMAT ABDYMOMUNOV, FILIPPO CURTI, ATANAS MIHOV",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12661,"Using supervisory data from large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we find that BHCs incur more operational losses in adverse macroeconomic conditions driven significantly by the higher frequency and severity of tail events. Among different operational risk types, we find that losses from BHCs' failure to meet obligations to clients or from the design of their products are particularly countercyclical. We also show that larger and more leveraged BHCs have a higher macroeconomic sensitivity of operational risk. Overall, our findings provide new evidence regarding U.S. banking organizations' exposure to macroeconomic shocks with implications for risk management practices and supervisory policy."
54,Seven Fallacies Concerning Milton Friedman's “The Role of Monetary Policy”,EDWARD NELSON,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12591,"This paper analyzes Milton Friedman's (1968a) article “The Role of Monetary Policy,” via a discussion of seven fallacies concerning the article. These fallacies are as follows: (i) “The Role of Monetary Policy” was Friedman's first public statement of the natural rate hypothesis. (ii) The Friedman–Phelps Phillips curve was already present in Samuelson and Solow's (1960) analysis. (iii) Friedman's specification of the Phillips curve was based on perfect competition and no nominal rigidities. (iv) Friedman's (1968a) account of monetary policy in the Great Depression contradicted the Monetary History’s version. (v) Friedman (1968a) stated that a monetary expansion will keep the unemployment rate and the real interest rate below their natural rates for two decades. (vi) The zero lower bound on nominal interest rates invalidates the natural rate hypothesis. (vii) Friedman's (1968a) treatment of an interest‐rate peg was refuted by the rational expectations revolution. The discussion lays out the reasons why each of these seven items is a fallacy and infers key aspects of the framework underlying Friedman's (1968a) analysis."
55,Employment in the Great Recession: How Important Were Household Credit Supply Shocks?,DANIEL GARCÍA,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12617,"I pool data from all large multimarket lenders in the United States to estimate how many of the over 7 million jobs lost in the Great Recession can be explained by reductions in the supply of mortgage credit. I construct a mortgage credit supply instrument at the county level, the weighted average (by prerecession mortgage market shares) of liquidity‐driven lender shocks during the recession. The reduction in mortgage supply explains about 15% of the employment decline. The job losses are concentrated in construction and finance."
56,"Asymmetry, Complementarities, and State Dependence in Federal Reserve Forecasts","JULIETA CAUNEDO, RICCARDO DICECIO, IVANA KOMUNJER, MICHAEL T. OWYANG",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12590,"Forecasts are a central component of policymaking; the Federal Reserve's forecasts are published in a document called the Greenbook. Previous studies of the Greenbook's inflation forecasts have found them to be rationalizable but asymmetric if considering particular subperiods, for example, before and after the Volcker appointment. In these papers, forecasts are analyzed in isolation, assuming policymakers value them independently. We analyze the Greenbook forecasts in a framework in which the forecast errors for different variables are allowed to interact. We find that allowing the losses to interact makes the unemployment forecasts virtually symmetric, the output forecasts symmetric prior to the Volcker appointment, and the inflation forecasts symmetric after the onset of the Great Moderation."
57,Fiscal Requirements for Dynamic and Real Determinacies in Economies with Private Provision of Liquidity: A Monetarist Assessment,PEDRO GOMIS‐PORQUERAS,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12587,"We study the impact of fiscal policies on the inherent links between inflation, unemployment, and asset prices in an environment where firms provide liquidity and the central bank follows a constant money growth rate rule. Firms, other than hiring workers, also supply private assets that are not only useful as a store of value but also as collateral. When firms are not taxed and public debt is scarce, the economy is non‐Ricardian so that real indeterminacies can be observed. Moreover, labor market characteristics do not affect the demand for government liabilities. However, when agents face public and private asset scarcity, labor market conditions then impact asset prices and inflation. We further show that irrespective of the type of asset scarcity agents face, when firms are taxed non‐ad valorem, not only the level of tax revenues but also its composition matter for real allocations. Moreover, we show that labor market conditions directly affect the dynamics of all government liabilities and inflation."
58,Nominal GDP Targeting and the Taylor Rule on an Even Playing Field,"DAVID BECKWORTH, JOSHUA R. HENDRICKSON",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmcb.12602,"Some economists advocate nominal GDP targeting as an alternative to the Taylor Rule. These arguments are largely based on the idea that nominal GDP targeting would require less knowledge on the part of policymakers than a traditional Taylor Rule. In particular, a nominal GDP targeting rule would not require real‐time knowledge of the output gap. We examine the importance of this claim by amending a standard New Keynesian model to assume that the central bank has imperfect information about the output gap and therefore must forecast the output gap based on previous information. Forecast errors by the central bank can then potentially induce unanticipated changes in the short‐term nominal interest rate, distinct from a standard monetary policy shock. We show that forecast errors of the output gap by the Federal Reserve can account for up to 13% of the fluctuations in the output gap. In addition, our simulations imply that a nominal GDP targeting rule would produce lower volatility in both inflation and the output gap in comparison with the Taylor Rule under imperfect information."
