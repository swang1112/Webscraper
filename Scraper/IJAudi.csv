2,"Economic bonding, corporate governance and earnings management: Evidence from UK publicly traded family firms","Jihad Al‐Okaily, Nourhene BenYoussef, Salim Chahine",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12186,"This study examines whether auditor–client economic bonding and corporate governance moderate the adverse effects of principal–principal agency problems on earnings quality in U.K.‐listed family firms. We find that although earnings management is lower in family firms, there is a higher tendency of earnings management for those firms with economic bonding. However, such an impact may be moderated by good governance mechanisms where the latter may alleviate the adverse effects of the lack of auditor independence on the association between earnings management and family firms."
3,Political alignment and audit pricing,"Cameron Truong, Mukesh Garg, Christofer Adrian, Anh Viet Pham, Philip Shane",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12189,"This article investigates the impact of political alignment on the pricing of audit service for U.S. firms. While prior studies have mainly focused on the political connectedness stemming from firms' active political effort, our study is different as we exploit changes in the U.S. political landscape, which are exogenous to firms. We employ a political alignment index (PAI) of each state's leading politicians with the presidential party to proxy for U.S. domestic firms' political alignment. We build upon the policy risk theory, and conjecture that auditors take into account the risk emanating from firms' political geography position and price this risk in their audit service fees. Our empirical results show a positive association between PAI and audit fees. Collectively, our findings suggest that auditors perceive firms whose headquarters are located in more politically aligned states to be riskier, while corporate diversification and managerial ability act as effective mitigating factors."
4,Do key audit matters impact financial reporting behavior?,"Anna Gold, Melina Heilmann, Christiane Pott, Johanna Rematzki",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12190,"This study experimentally examines whether the implementation of key audit matters (KAMs) in auditors' reports affects managers' reporting behavior. In line with prior research in psychology, we argue that greater transparency through KAMs leads to higher accountability pressure as managers may expect their judgments to be scrutinized more strongly in the presence of KAMs and, hence, to an improvement of financial reporting quality. Further, we examine whether informational precision (firm‐specific versus nonfirm‐specific information) in a KAM section moderates the effect of KAM presence on reporting behavior. Our findings show that managers' tendency to make an aggressive financial reporting decision is reduced in the presence of KAMs (compared to the absence of KAMs). This effect remains even when the description of the KAM is of low informational precision. Thus, our results suggest that KAMs serve as a beneficial mechanism for enhancing financial reporting quality by attenuating aggressive financial reporting behavior, regardless of the precision employed by auditors."
5,Group audits and earnings informativeness,"Johannes Impink, Alexey Lyubimov, Ashna Prasad",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12191,"The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has cited investors as the main stakeholder group requesting greater disclosure about the involvement of auditors other than the group auditor. This study investigates the following: 1) whether (any) differences in investor perceived earnings quality of group audits are associated with the component auditor belonging to the same network as the group auditor and; 2) whether this association is affected by the location of the client. We find that earnings informativeness is lower for group audits conducted by audit firms related by a global network. However, this finding is pertinent only to non‐US‐domiciled companies. We also find that since the escalation of PCAOB scrutiny, the earnings informativeness of non‐U.S. companies has increased."
6,Applying a new audit regulation: Reporting Key Audit Matters in Jordan,"Modar Abdullatif, Ayat S. Al‐Rahahleh",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12192,"This study aims to explore the application of a new audit regulation, International Standard on Auditing no. 701 (ISA 701) on Key Audit Matters (KAMs), in the developing country context of Jordan. To do so, the researchers analyzed the content of audit reports issued in Jordan in 2017 and 2018, and conducted interviews with 18 Jordanian audit partners and directors involved in KAM reporting. Findings of this study show that the number of KAMs reported in Jordan is relatively small, and that they emphasize items such as accounts receivable, inventory, investment property, and revenue. They also show that audit firms generally disagree on the nature and content of KAMs, overwhelmingly tend to report industry‐specific KAMs rather than entity‐specific KAMs, and avoid reporting KAMs related to governance or internal controls. Justifications by interviewees include ambiguity of ISA 701 and discretion in its application, fear of displeasing closely held clients who do not demand high‐quality audits, and limited interest by regulatory authorities in the detailed content of KAMs."
7,The auditor reputation cycle: A synthesis of the literature,"Jason Bergner, Blair B. Marquardt, Partha Mohapatra",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12193,"The auditor reputation hypothesis states that auditors conduct high‐quality audits to build a positive reputation in the marketplace so that they can retain clients and earn fee premiums. We consolidate the dispersed literature on this hypothesis and introduce a framework that presents auditor reputation as a cycle. The overall conclusions support the predictions of our framework regarding reputation as an incentive for audit quality. However, challenges remain in isolating and quantifying the impact. We observe moderating factors on both the supply and demand sides. We also find that existing research has emphasized certain aspects of our framework while addressing others more sparsely. Relatively little is known about how audit firms earn their reputation or how they rebuild it after an audit failure. Mixed evidence in some areas, along with research gaps in the framework, provides opportunities for future research on auditor reputation. Our framework can guide these endeavors."

10,The impact of the Sarbanes–Oxley Section 404(b) exemption on earnings informativeness,"Alexey Lyubimov, Larry Davis, Greg Trompeter",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12174,We investigate whether firms who voluntarily drop compliance with Section 404(b) of Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX)—the requirement to have an outside auditor conduct an audit of internal control over financial reporting—suffer a loss of earnings informativeness. Section 404(b) has been widely criticized for imposing costs in excess of the benefits to investors. Calls for wholesale repeal and increasingly wide exemptions from compliance continue to this day. The fact that non‐US regulators have not passed similar regulation outside of the USA appears to be partially driven by similar cost concerns. Our results indicate that voluntary dropping of 404(b) is associated with a drop in earnings informativeness. This result is driven primarily by financially distressed companies. Our results address previous calls for research about the market's perception of 404(b) compliance and suggest that regulators may wish to consider firm characteristics when determining which firms should be required to purchase an audit of internal control over financial reporting.
11,Why do firms seek shareholders ratification of the independent audit function? The case of foreign cross‐listed companies in the United States,"Paul Tanyi, Jack Cathey",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12175,"Many factors influence why companies require routine auditor ratifications. In this study, we seek to examine factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of shareholders’ involvement in the ratification of the independent auditor's appointment for foreign cross‐listed companies in the United States. Foreign cross‐listed companies provide a unique opportunity to observe how country‐specific factors impact the auditor ratification vote decision and outcome. Our analysis shows that bank financing, the location of the cross‐listed firm's independent auditor (U.S.‐based vs. non‐U.S.‐based audit office), and non‐audit fee ratio as having the highest marginal effects on the probability of companies requiring their shareholders to ratify the auditor's appointment. We also examine how these factors influence the outcome of the vote. We find that several engagement and country‐specific factors also influence the outcome of the vote."
12,Institutional Investor Trading Around Auditor's Going Concern Modified Opinions: An Analysis of Mutual Funds and Pension Funds,"Marshall A. Geiger, Sami Keskek, Abdullah Kumas",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12176,"We contribute to auditing literature by examining trading behavior of mutual and pension funds around first‐time going concern modified opinions (GCMO). We find that mutual funds are significant net sellers of GCMO firms in the period before the GCMO announcement and then decrease their net selling at the GCMO announcement. In contrast, pension funds appear to be less active net sellers in the pre‐GCMO period and then significantly increase their net selling as an immediate response to the GCMO announcement, and then reduce their net selling in the post‐GCMO period. Our net selling results are robust to a battery of additional tests, including alternative specifications of the GCMO event window, using an extended pre‐GCMO benchmark period, controlling for 8‐K and earnings announcements, excluding subsequently bankrupt firms and using change variables in our models. In additional analyses, we find that overall trading volume increases for both mutual and pension funds at the GCMO announcement. Our examination of trading behavior provides initial evidence on differences between these two groups of institutional investors in their trading response to first‐time GCMOs, and enables us to provide a more robust assessment of the information content of GCMOs for these different groups of sophisticated market participants."
13,Exploring the conceptual structure of the auditing discipline through co‐word analysis: An international perspective,"Ali Uyar, Merve Kılıç, Mehmet Ali Koseoglu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12178,"The purpose of this study was to explore the conceptual structure of the auditing discipline between 2000 and 2016, by synthesizing keywords cited in 2,119 articles published in 24 accounting and auditing journals, using co‐word analysis and social network analysis (SNA). We aimed to highlight dominant, fading, and emerging themes in the discipline across the periods and across continents. The main outputs of this study can be summarized as follows. The consistent decline in fragmentation, and the increase in connectedness, within the SNA showed that the auditing discipline became an increasingly tight and more cohesive network. While the generic keywords auditing and auditor were used far less frequently in the final period of the study, the keywords audit quality, audit fees, internal control, financial reporting quality, and continuous auditing were increasingly cited across the study periods. Moreover, regional analyzes unveiled similarities and differences between territories."
14,Auditors' Response to Different Reporting Environments: Experimental Evidence From the Quantity and Quality of Auditors' Evidence Demands in China,"June Cao, Paul J. Coram",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12179,"There has been a significant worldwide movement to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are more principles‐based compared to many of the more rules‐based national accounting standards that they replaced. The majority of previous studies focus on how this financial reporting environment change influences earnings quality, while there has been limited research on how auditors respond to IFRS. We perform an experiment using Chinese professional auditors to test the joint effects of the type of accounting standards and the strength of the financial regulatory regime on both the quantity and quality of auditors' evidence demands. We find that auditors are likely to have more evidence demands and, particularly, more diagnostic evidence demands under principles‐based accounting standards. This influence is more pronounced under the stronger financial regulatory regime. The effect of the institutional environment on IFRS standards is an important international reporting topic particularly for emerging markets like China where there is strong economic growth with an increased focus on reporting standards and regulation. China is an ideal environment to examine this topic because it is the largest country in the world to adopt IFRS, and many Chinese auditors have experienced both rules‐ and principles‐based accounting standards."
15,External auditors' evaluation of a management's expert's credibility: Evidence from Australia,"Prerana Agrawal, Ann Tarca, David Woodliff",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12181,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has concerns that auditors are not adequately evaluating the reliability of the work of management's experts (MEs). We interviewed nine experienced auditors to understand how auditors evaluate MEs. We observe that some factors specified by auditing standards, such as an ME's competency in accounting standards, geographical location of the subject matter or the ME, and the sourcing of an ME play a minor role in an auditor's evaluation of an ME's credibility. In contrast, the reputation of an ME's firm is a key determinant. Auditors corroborate information from multiple sources, but verify only the ME's professional qualification. We identify three potential reasons for the ASIC's concerns: “Experts are considered cognitive authorities,” “Documentation is the key,” and “Move from a risk‐based approach to a checklist approach.”"
16,The Time Dependence of Audit Firm Alumni Effects: Evidence from Audit Committees,"Matthias F. Baumann, Nicole V. S. Ratzinger‐Sakel",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12182,"This article empirically examines the time dependence of audit quality and audit fee effects resulting from the presence of audit firm alumni (AFA) on audit committees (ACs) in the German setting. Following the European Union's audit reform in 2014, the subject of this study is of particular importance, as European regulators have strengthened the position of ACs, while simultaneously restricting the presence of AFA on ACs. We find that the presence of AFA who have recently left their former employer on ACs is associated with higher audit quality, while we fail to find a significant effect on audit quality with regard to AFA who have left audit firms a longer period of time ago. In addition, the presence of AFA on ACs does not seem to affect audit fees. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate time‐dependent AFA effects related to ACs."
17,Are going‐concern issues disclosed in audit reports associated with subsequent bankruptcy? Evidence from the United States,"Vikram Desai, Renu Desai, Joung W. Kim, Kannan Raghunandan",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12183,"The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has expressed interest in the following issues related to going‐concern modified audit opinions (GCOs): auditor's communication of factors that led to the GCO, the role of liquidity versus other factors in GCOs, and the subsequent failures of clients with GCOs. We use a sample of 2,921 first‐time GCOs spanning the years 1999 to 2015 in the United States and find that profitability factors are cited in 81% of GCOs while liquidity issues are cited in 56% of GCOs. Overall, 16.8% of the first‐time GCO clients entered bankruptcy within one year. After controlling for the probability of bankruptcy, client size, and auditor type, for clients of Big N auditors, the disclosure of profitability factors in the GCO is associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent bankruptcy; in contrast, for clients of non–Big N auditors, disclosures of liquidity and solvency problems are associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent bankruptcy. Our findings provide an empirical grounding for the debates surrounding GCOs and provide useful information for standard‐setters and financial statement users."
18,Corporate choice of providers of voluntary carbon assurance,"Rina Datt, Le Luo, Qingliang Tang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12184,"This study investigates corporate incentives for the choice of assurance providers of accounting firms versus nonaccounting firms. Based on an international sample of 3,635 firm‐year observations for the period of 2010–2014, we find that firms subject to greater legitimacy and stakeholder pressure (e.g., those with higher carbon emissions in countries with stringent climate protection and stakeholder‐orientation) are more likely to choose accounting firms as their assurance provider. We also find supporting evidence that firms with a desire to improve carbon management mechanisms (e.g., firms that adopt carbon reduction incentives with higher carbon transparency) show a tendency to choose consulting firms specializing in climate change management. The overall findings suggest that the choice of assurance provider is a strategic decision, which aligns with a firm's overall corporate social responsibility goal. Our results should help practitioners, managers, and regulators understand the emerging audit practice and market."
19,Dual–class ownership structure and audit fees,"Olesya Lobanova, Suchismita Mishra, Kannan Raghunandan, Alexandre Aidov",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijau.12185,"A dual‐class share structure creates a separation between cash flow rights and voting rights. Dual‐class firms impact audit fees through their effect on supply/demand for auditing. This article examines the association between audit fees and dual‐class share structure for U.S. public firms. We find that a dual‐class share structure is associated with lower audit fees compared to single‐class firms. Further, within dual‐class firms, we find that the divergence between cash flow rights and voting rights is negatively associated with audit fees. The results are consistent with the managerial incentive‐alignment effect and/or the insulation effect of a dual‐class share structure on the supply/demand for audit services. This study highlights that the ownership structure of a firm constitutes an important role in audit pricing."
