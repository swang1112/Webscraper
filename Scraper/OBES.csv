1,Forecasting GDP Growth from Outer Space,Jaqueson K. Galimberti,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12361,"We evaluate the usefulness of satellite‐based data on night‐time lights for forecasting GDP growth across a global sample of countries, proposing innovative location‐based indicators to extract new predictive information from the lights data. Our findings are generally favourable to the use of night lights data to improve the accuracy of model‐based forecasts. We also find a substantial degree of heterogeneity across countries in the relationship between lights and economic activity: individually estimated models tend to outperform panel specifications. Key factors underlying the night lights performance include the country's size and income level, logistics infrastructure, and the quality of national statistics."
2,Domestic Violence and Child Mortality in the Developing World,"Samantha Rawlings, Zahra Siddique",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12357,"We examine the effect of domestic violence on child mortality using Demographic and Health Surveys from thirty‐two developing countries. We first examine conditional associations between violence faced by the mother and child mortality after controlling for observable confounders. Children of (ever) physically victimized mothers are 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 pp more likely to die within thirty days, a year, and five years of being born. We find similar associations when examining violence experienced in the last twelve months, although these are no longer statistically significant. The association is statistically significant, and larger, if the mother experiences violence in the last twelve months often, rather than sometimes. Violence is significantly associated with pregnancy loss, suggesting the true effect on mortality is larger than estimates based on live‐births would suggest. We investigate robustness of associations to omitted variable bias, assessing the role of selection on unobservables to estimate lower bounds on the true effect. These continue to indicate economically meaningful positive effects, suggesting selection on unobservables would need to be 2.4–3 times that of selection on observables to nullify the estimated effect. We provide evidence that maternal smoking and breastfeeding practices are mediators in the relationship between domestic violence and child mortality."
3,Identifying the Dynamic Effects of Income Inequality on Crime,Bebonchu Atems,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12359,"What happens to crime after an increase in income inequality? The microeconomics literature that attempts to answer this question often employs identification strategies that exploit external sources of variation that provide quasi‐experiments to identify causal effects. In contrast, this paper tackles this question by using structural vector autoregressions (SVAR), a methodology typically employed in modern empirical macroeconomics to identify and estimate dynamic causal effects of exogenous shocks. Unlike the macroeconomic SVAR models that are often applied to time‐series data, we exploit the time series and cross‐sectional dimensions of our data, leading to the estimation of panel SVAR models. Using U.S. state‐level data for the period 1960–2015, our results indicate that structural shocks to inequality increase both violent and property crime. Variance decomposition analyses show that inequality has little explanatory power for movements in crime."
4,The Wage Penalty for Married Women of Career Interruptions: Evidence from the 1970s and the 1990s,"John Bailey Jones, Minhee Kim, Byoung G. Park",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12356,"The goal of this paper is to assess how the wage penalty for career interruptions by married women changed between the 1970s and the 1990s. We estimate the wage penalty for career interruptions using the work‐history model and PSID data. We use several approaches to control for various forms of endogeneity and selection bias. Our empirical results suggest that (i) the wage penalty for married women's career interruptions increased from 40.4% to 73.7% over the period, (ii) the ratio of the wage penalty for married women to that of married men also increased, from 1.33 to 2.43, (iii) Blinder–Oaxaca decompositions show that changes in education‐ or occupation‐specific wage penalties account for most of the wage penalty increase."
5,Distributional Effects of a Continuous Treatment with an Application on Intergenerational Mobility,"Brantly Callaway, Weige Huang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12355,"This paper considers the effect of a continuous treatment on the entire distribution of outcomes after adjusting for differences in the distribution of covariates across different levels of the treatment. Our methodology encompasses dose‐response functions, counterfactual distributions, and ‘distributional policy effects’ depending on the assumptions invoked by the researcher. We propose a three‐step estimator that consists of (i) estimating the distribution of the outcome conditional on the treatment and other covariates using quantile regression; (ii) for each value of the treatment, averaging over a counterfactual distribution of the covariates holding the treatment fixed; (iii) converting the resulting counterfactual distribution into parameters of interest that are easy to interpret. We show that our estimators converge uniformly to Gaussian processes and that the empirical bootstrap can be used to conduct uniformly valid inference across a range of values of the treatment. We use our method to study intergenerational income mobility where we consider effects of parents’ income on features of their child's income distribution such as (i) the fraction of children with income below the poverty line; (ii) the variance of child's income; and (iii) the inter‐quantile range of child's income–all as a function of parents’ income."
6,Labour Supply after Inheritances and the Role of Expectations,"Karina Doorley, Nico Pestel",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12353,"This paper examines the effect of inheritances on labour supply, distinguishing between unanticipated and anticipated inheritances. We use household and individual level micro‐data for Germany to investigate the effect of inheritances on a number of labour market outcomes. Women are less likely to work full‐time after an inheritance and their desired and actual hours of work decrease by 1–2 per week, on average. The magnitude of the effect is found to be larger and more precisely estimated for households without children and liquidity constrained households. Other margins such as time use outside the labour market and satisfaction are also found to be affected by inheritance receipt."
7,Europe Through the Crisis: Discretionary Policy Changes and Automatic Stabilizers,"Alari Paulus, Iva Valentinova Tasseva",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12354,"Tax‐benefit policies affect changes in household incomes through two main channels: discretionary policy changes and automatic stabilizers. We study their role in the EU countries in 2007–14 using an extended decomposition approach. Our results show that the two policy actions often reduced rather than increased inequality of net incomes, and so helped offset the inequality‐increasing impact of growing disparities in gross market incomes. While inequality reductions were achieved mainly through benefits using both routes, policy changes to and the automatic stabilization response of taxes and contributions raised inequality in some countries and lowered it in others."
8,"Private Sector Debt, Financial Constraints, and the Effects of Monetary Policy: Evidence from the US","Max Breitenlechner, Johann Scharler",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12349,"We characterize the response of U.S. real GDP to monetary policy shocks conditional on the level of private sector debt and the degree to which financial constraints are binding. To incorporate state‐dependent effects of monetary policy, we use the local projection framework. We find that although the amount of private sector debt potentially weakens the monetary policy transmission mechanism, policy shocks exert substantially larger effects on output when high private debt coincides with binding financial constraints."
9,Campaign Contributions by Non‐profit Executives and Government Grants,Christian Cox,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12341,"United States election candidates seek monetary support for their campaigns and many individuals oblige. Non‐profit organizations are limited in their political spending, but their executives, in a personal capacity, are not. This paper investigates whether individual campaign contributions are a political workaround for non‐profits. I pair non‐profit tax filings and Federal Election Commission records to form the first large‐scale panel linking non‐profit executive contributions and non‐profit financials. My analysis covers the 1998, 2000 and 2002 elections for 29,682 non‐profit organizations. I estimate a series of models and find an economically significant, robust and positive relationship."
10,Job Reallocation Dynamics in India: Evidence from Large Manufacturing Plants,"Bhaskar Jyoti Neog, Bimal Kishore Sahoo",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12350,"The paper contributes to the limited literature on job reallocation dynamics in Indian manufacturing. The study uses annual data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the years 2000–01 to 2015–16. The study finds job reallocation in India to be quite high compared to flexible labour markets such as the United States and Canada. Gross job reallocation shows a rising trend over time, which is driven partially by the increasing share of contract workers in the workforce. There is heterogeneity in the job reallocation dynamics across job types. This is evident in the relative importance of the different job types as plants adjust to permanent and temporary changes in demand. Labour regulations also play an important role in such a process. Finally, in contrast to the evidence for the United States and the United Kingdom, our study found firm evidence to reject the hypothesis that job reallocation is countercyclical in India."

12,We just estimated twenty million fiscal multipliers,"Jan Čapek, Jesús Crespo Cuaresma",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12351,"We analyse the role played by data and specification choices as determinants of the size of the fiscal multipliers obtained using structural vector autoregressive models. The results, based on over twenty million fiscal multipliers estimated for European countries, indicate that many seemingly harmless modelling choices have a significant effect on the size and precision of fiscal multiplier estimates. In addition to the structural shock identification strategy, these modelling choices include the definition of spending and taxes, the national accounts system employed, the use of particular interest rates or inflation measures, or whether data are smoothed prior to estimation. The cumulative effects of such arguably innocuous methodological choices can lead to a change in the spending multipliers of as much as 0.4 points."
13,Transmission of a Resource Boom:  The Case of Australia,"Mardi Dungey, Renee Fry‐Mckibbin, Vladimir Volkov",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12352,"This paper presents evidence on the macroeconomic adjustment of a resource‐rich country to a resource boom using the effects of Chinese industrialization on Australia from 1988 to 2016. An SVAR model is specified, incorporating a proxy for Chinese resource demand and commodity prices to identify the effects of commodity supply and demand shocks on the Australian macroeconomy. We develop a multivariate historical decomposition to show how resource sector shocks lead the economy to deviate from a long‐run projection. The paper identifies four phases of the transmission of the resource boom before its conclusion in 2015."
14,The Impact of  Terrorism on Social Capital: Evidence from the 2015 Charlie Hebdo Paris Shooting,"Shawn J. McCoy, Ian K. McDonough, Punarjit Roychowdhury",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12343,"We examine the impact of terrorism on social capital by exploiting variation in the 2014 European Social Survey administration dates coupled with the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, France. Using the difference‐in‐differences estimator, we find that the attack had a positive, causal impact on the overall level of social capital among French respondents. Further, the effect seems to be driven by an increase in institutional and interpersonal trust, as well as by engagement in social networks. This rise in social capital peaks in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack but subsequently decays to pre‐attack levels within approximately one month."
15,Productivity Shocks and Labour Market Outcomes for Top Earners: Evidence from Italian Serie A,"Vincenzo Carrieri, Andrew M. Jones, Francesco Principe",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12347,"How are top earners affected by productivity shocks? We address this question using a unique longitudinal data set on the universe of professional football players in the Italian Serie A, representing 20% of top earners in Italy. We use traumatic injuries and adopt an IV strategy to provide causal estimates of the impact of productivity shocks on several labour market outcomes. We find that a 30‐day injury substantially affects the probability of contract renegotiation and reduces net wages by around 12%. We show that this large penalty is due to employer's precautionary motives rather than to shock‐induced reduction in current player's performance."
16,Labour Supply and Childcare:  Allowing Both Parents to Choose,"Karen Mumford, Antonia Parera‐Nicolau, Yolanda Pena‐Boquete",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12340,"We develop and estimate a structural model of labour supply for two parent families in Australia, taking explicit account of the importance of childcare related variables. Our main contribution is to consider the labour supply decisions of both parents and their choice of childcare simultaneously. Labour supply decisions of mothers are found to be substantially more responsive to changes in their own wage (at intensive and extensive margins) than is the case for fathers, with minimal cross‐wage labour supply responses from fathers. Our results imply that policies increasing the wage of mothers will be associated with marked increases in labour market participation and in the working hours of mothers in the Australian labour market, with little offsetting decline in the labour supply of fathers."
17,Does Mobility across Universities Raise Scientific Productivity?,"Olof Ejermo, Claudio Fassio, John Källström",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12346,"Using a highly comprehensive new data set on Swedish researchers, we investigate the effects of inter‐university mobility on researcher productivity. Our study suggests substantial gains from mobility on scientific output. The empirical analysis addresses selection using inverse probability treatment censoring weights. We find that mobility induces a long‐lasting increase in a researcher's publications by 32% and citations by 63%. Such mobility effects are not explained by promotions taking place jointly with a move. Positive effects are found among individuals who move between universities and not for those who move to or from university colleges. Moreover, we find that the positive effect of moving only applies to researchers in medicine, natural sciences and engineering and technology, with no effect of mobility found in the social sciences and in the humanities."
18,"Liquidity Constraints, Unemployed Job Search and Labour Market Outcomes","Ruud Gerards, Riccardo Welters",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12345,"Liquidity constraints prompt the unemployed to intensify their job search, but does that produce better labour market outcomes? Using longitudinal Australian data, we test the effect of objective proxy indicators of liquidity constraints on job search and concomitant labour market outcomes. We find that liquidity constraints, specifically their severe form ‘hardship’, intensify job search without improving short‐run employment outcomes or objective job quality (if a job is secured), whereas subjective job quality outcomes are worse. Moreover, we find evidence that the quit intention is higher and the concomitant medium‐run employment stability is lower for those who found jobs facing hardship."
19,Wage Differentials and  Workers’ Effort: Experimental Evidence from Uganda,"John Sseruyange, Erwin Bulte",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12344,"We organize a real‐effort field experiment with varying piece rates to assess the impact of wages and social comparisons on productivity. In addition to analyzing how piece rates and social comparisons affect productivity during the ‘paid stage’ of the experiment, we also consider how they affect effort supply during a voluntary and unpaid follow‐up task. Our main results are that effort supply is relatively unresponsive to variation in own earnings, but responds strongly to pay inequality. While we obtain weak support for the hypothesis that positive social comparisons invite extra effort during paid stages of the experiment, our most important finding is that social comparisons matter for voluntary tasks when shirking is cheap. Specifically, positive social comparisons positively affect productivity during unpaid tasks, and negative comparisons have the opposite impact."
20,A Robust Sequential Procedure for Estimating the Number of Structural Changes in Persistence,Mohitosh Kejriwal,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12348,"This paper proposes a new procedure for estimating the number of structural changes in the persistence of a univariate time series. While the extant literature primarily assumes (regime‐wise) stationarity, our framework also allows the underlying stochastic process to switch between stationary [I(0)] and unit root regimes [I(1)]. We develop a sequential testing approach that maintains correct asymptotic size regardless of whether the regimes are I(0) or I(1). We also propose a novel procedure for distinguishing persistence change processes from those with pure level and/or trend shifts. Monte Carlo simulations and an application to OECD inflation rates highlight the practical usefulness of the procedures."
21,A Note on Specification  Testing in Some Structural Regression Models,Walter Beckert,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12342,"There exists a useful framework for jointly implementing Durbin–Wu–Hausman exogeneity and Sargan–Hansen overidentification tests, as a single artificial regression. This note sets out the framework for linear models and discusses its extension to nonlinear models. It also provides an empirical example and some Monte Carlo results."

23,Estimating Excess Sensitivity and Habit Persistence in Consumption Using Greenbook Forecasts,"Vipul Bhatt, N. Kundan Kishor, Hardik Marfatia",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12333,"In this paper, we revisit the issue of excess sensitivity of consumption to income and address the weak instrument problem that is well documented in this literature. Using quarterly data for the US economy, we first highlight the weak instrument problem by showing that the use of conventional instruments tends to overestimate the share of rule‐of‐thumb consumers. To address this weak instrument problem, we propose a new instrument for endogenous disposable income growth in the consumption function, namely, the Greenbook forecast of real disposable income growth. We show that this instrument encompasses the information contained in the conventional set of instruments, and is a superior predictor of income growth. We find that using our proposed instrument ameliorates the weak instrument problem and provides a much smaller estimate for the rule‐of‐thumb consumers. We also extend our empirical framework to allow for habit persistence and provide an estimate for this important parameter of the consumption function. Finally, we use a time‐varying specification of consumption function that allows for endogenous regressors, and document a decline in the share of rule‐of‐thumb consumers and a rise in the habit‐persistence parameter in the US over our sample period."
24,Do Central Banks Respond  Timely to Developments in the Global Economy?,"Hilde C. Bj⊘rnland, Leif Anders Thorsrud, Sepideh Khayati Zahiri",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12335,"Our analysis suggests; they do not! We arrive at this conclusion by showing that revisions to the published interest rate path projections from the central banks in New Zealand, Norway and Sweden can be predicted by timely and forward‐looking international indicators. Furthermore, using individual country and Panel VARs, identified with an external instrument method, we show that the policy surprises induced by the predictable revisions likely contain information about how the central banks assess past, current and future economic conditions and thereby leads to a positive co‐movement between the interest rate and both financial markets and the macroeconomy."
25,"What Drives Commodity Returns? Market, Sector or Idiosyncratic Factors?","Jun Ma, Andrew Vivian, Mark E. Wohar",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12334,"This paper examines the relationship between 43 commodity returns using a dynamic factor model with time varying stochastic volatility. The dynamic factor model decomposes each commodity return into a common (market), sector‐specific and commodity‐specific component. It enables the variance attributed to each component to be estimated at each point in time. We find the return variation explained by the common factor has increased substantially for the recent period and is statistically significant for the vast majority of commodities since 2004 (at each point in time) This phenomenon is the strongest for non‐perishable products. We link the amount of variation explained by the common factor to economic variables."
26,"Investment, Tobin's Q, and Cash Flow Across Time and Frequencies",Fabio Verona,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12321,"The investment literature has long acknowledged the time‐ and frequency‐varying dynamics of the relationship between investment, Tobin's Q and cash flow. In this paper, we use continuous wavelet tools to estimate and assess the relationship between these variables simultaneously at different frequencies and over time. We find that (i) Q and cash flow are complementary sources of information for investment, the former being more important for firms’ investment decisions in the medium‐to‐long run and the latter at business cycles frequencies; and (ii) investment‐Q sensitivity declines over time at all frequencies, while investment–cash flow sensitivity declines at business cycles frequencies but remains largely stable over the medium‐to‐long run."
27,Leverage Dynamics and the Burden of Debt,"Mikael Juselius, Mathias Drehmann",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12330,"In addition to leverage, the debt service burden of households and firms is an important link between financial and real developments at the aggregate level. Using US data from 1985 to 2017, we find that the debt service burden has sizeable negative effects on expenditure. Its interplay with leverage also explains several data puzzles, including the lack of above‐trend output growth during credit booms and the severity of ensuing recessions, without appealing to large shocks or nonlinearities. Estimating the model with data up to 2005, it predicts credit and expenditure paths that closely match actual developments before and during the Great Recession."
28,Income Tax Progressivity: Trends and Implications,"Claudia Gerber, Alexander Klemm, Li Liu, Victor Mylonas",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12331,"This paper discusses how the structure of the tax system affects its progressivity. It suggests a measure of progressive capacity of tax systems, based on the Kakwani index, but independent of pretax income distributions. Using this and other progressivity measures, the paper (i) documents a decline in progressivity over the last decades and (ii) examines the relationship between progressivity and economic growth. On this relationship, regressions do not reveal a significant impact, suggesting that efficiency costs may be small – at least for degrees of progressivity observed in the sample. Finally, the paper finds that increasing tax progressivity reduces pretax inequality."
29,Testing Ricardian Equivalence with the Narrative Record on  Tax Changes,Alfred A. Haug,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12339,"The Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is tested empirically with a subcategory of the narrative measures of US tax shocks developed by Romer and Romer (in, American Economic Review 2010;100:763). The present value of tax increases motivated solely by concerns for improving the fiscal health of the government is used. These tax news represent a switch from debt to tax financing that should have no effects on real output and consumption. For the post‐1982:IV period, fiscal anticipation plays an important role as many of the tax increases are implemented with substantial delays. Anticipated tax hikes increase economic activity in the delay period. Ricardian equivalence is rejected."
30,The Beveridge Curve  Across US States: New Insights From a Pairwise  Approach,"Mark J. Holmes, Jesús Otero",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12337,"This paper offers new insights into Beveridge curve analysis by modelling the unemployment–vacancy rate relationship at state‐level within a pairwise environment in which the unemployment rate in one state is inversely related to the vacancy rate in another. We find that Beveridge curve shifting, or matching efficiency, is driven by factors that include distance between states, the labour force participation rate, homeownership and the relative affordability of housing between states. A pairwise recursive analysis points to a decrease in matching efficiency in the period that followed the Great Recession."
31,Identification of Economic Shocks by Inequality Constraints in Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression,"Markku Lanne, Jani Luoto",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12338,"Theories often make predictions about the signs of the effects of economic shocks on observable variables, thus implying inequality constraints on the parameters of a structural vector autoregression (SVAR). We introduce a new Bayesian procedure to evaluate the probabilities of such constraints, and, hence, to validate the theoretically implied economic shocks. We first estimate a SVAR, where the shocks are identified by statistical properties of the data, and subsequently label these statistically identified shocks by the Bayes factors calculated from their probabilities of satisfying given inequality constraints. In contrast to the related sign restriction approach that also makes use of theoretically implied inequality constraints, no restrictions are imposed. Hence, it is possible that only a subset or none of the theoretically implied shocks can be labelled. In the latter case, we conclude that the data do not lend support to the theory implying the signs of the effects in question. We illustrate the method by empirical applications to the crude oil market, and U.S. monetary policy."
32,Further Results on the  Weak Instruments Problem of the System  GMM  Estimator in Dynamic Panel Data Models,"Kazuhiko Hayakawa, Meng Qi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12336,"In this paper, we investigate the weak instruments problem of the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator for dynamic panel data models. Specifically, we complement Bun and Windmeijer (2010) by considering the alternative first‐difference and level models transformed by the forward GLS transformation. We demonstrate that this transformation yields a higher concentration parameter compared with the original models. This indicates that the proposed transformation yields stronger instruments even though the instruments used are identical. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that the system GMM estimator for the transformed model, called the forward system GMM estimator, performs better than the conventional system GMM estimator."

34,The Impact of Tropical Storms on Households: Evidence from Panel Data on Consumption,"Michael Henry, Nekeisha Spencer, Eric Strobl",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12328,"This paper investigates the impact of tropical storms on Jamaican household consumption. We build a panel data set that follows individual households over time thus enabling us to take account of time invariant household and location unobservables that could be correlated with mean tropical storm exposure. Our results show that while the average damaging hurricane reduces per capita consumption by approximately 1.1%, more destructive events can cause losses multiple times this amount. There are, however, heterogeneous impacts across households, where only those that live in buildings with less wind resistant walls are affected. Additionally, we find that households are able to partially buffer the negative impact on consumption through remittances and savings, as well as by shifting funds away from non‐regular expenditures. Again, households differ in the nature of this buffering according to the wind resistance of their buildings."
35,The Intended and Unintended Effects of Drunk Driving Policies,"Harrison Chang, Kehao Chang, Elliott Fan",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12326,"Taking advantage of merged administrative data, we estimate the intended and unintended effects of two public policies aimed at combating driving under influence (DUI) of alcohol in Taiwan: the three‐month‐long campaign of random sobriety checkpoints in mid‐2012, and the legal reform carried out in mid‐2013 leading to much harsher punishments for DUI offenders. Our study gives rise to several important findings: (i) The checkpoint campaign substantially reduced DUI deaths and injuries, and the effect persisted after the campaign ended; (ii) the campaign also had a strong spillover effect of reducing non‐DUI deaths and injuries, and this unintended effect was four times the size of the intended effect on DUI cases; (iii) these effects were not driven by social pressure or self‐awareness arising from the intensive media coverage taking place at the same time; and (iv) there was little response to either policy among repeat DUI offenders and those who caused serious injuries."
36,Elasticities and the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Transformation,"Marc F. Bellemare, Casey J. Wichman",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12325,Applied econometricians frequently apply the inverse hyperbolic sine (or arcsinh) transformation to a variable because it approximates the natural logarithm of that variable and allows retaining zero‐valued observations. We provide derivations of elasticities in common applications of the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation and show empirically that the difference in elasticities driven by ad hoc transformations can be substantial. We conclude by offering practical guidance for applied researchers.
37,The Elasticity of Substitution Between Capital and Labour in the US Economy: A Meta‐Regression Analysis,"Michael Knoblach, Martin Roessler, Patrick Zwerschke",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12312,"Despite extensive research, there is no agreement on the value of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour at the aggregate or the industrial level. Utilizing 2,419 estimates from 77 studies published between 1961 and 2017, this paper provides the first meta‐regression analysis for the US economy. We show that the heterogeneity in previously reported estimates is driven primarily by modelling decisions for technological dynamics. Throughout the analysis, the hypothesis of a Cobb–Douglas production function is rejected. Based on our meta‐regression sample, we estimate a long‐run meta‐elasticity for the aggregate economy in the range of 0.45–0.87. Most industrial estimates do not deviate significantly from the estimate for the aggregate economy."
38,Time‐Varying Relationship between Inflation and Inflation Uncertainty,Chenghan Hou,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12327,"This paper investigates whether the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty has changed and whether the change in this relationship has been gradual or abrupt. We extend the time‐varying parameter with stochastic volatility in mean model (TVP‐SVM) to include a mixture innovation disturbance in the time‐varying parameter process. The proposed model produces more reliable estimates and allows us to investigate the occurrence of breaks in the gradually evolving process of the time varying coefficients. Using data of US, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, UK, France, Italy, Spain and Australia, we find that: (i) the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty substantially varies over time; (ii) there is strong support for the existence of abrupt changes in the US inflation–inflation uncertainty relationship; (iii) our empirical results of Canada and New Zealand show that the correlation between inflation and inflation uncertainty has been much weaker since early 1990s, which coincides with the timing of the implementation of inflation targeting."
39,Economic Policy Uncertainty Spillovers in Booms and Busts,"Giovanni Caggiano, Efrem Castelnuovo, Juan Manuel Figueres",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12323,"We estimate a nonlinear VAR to quantify the impact of US economic policy uncertainty shocks on the Canadian unemployment rate in booms and busts. We find strong evidence in favour of asymmetric spillover effects. Unemployment in Canada is shown to react more strongly to uncertainty shocks in economic busts. Such shocks explain about 13% of the variance of the 2‐year ahead forecast error of the Canadian unemployment rate in recessions vs. just 2% during economic booms. Counterfactual simulations point to a novel ‘economic policy uncertainty spillovers channel’. According to this channel, jumps in US uncertainty foster economic policy uncertainty in Canada in the first place and, because of the latter, lead to a temporary increase in the Canadian unemployment rate. Evidence of asymmetric spillover effects are also found for the UK economy, whose trade intensity with the US is low. This result is consistent with a transmission channel other than trade behind our findings."
40,Rules versus Discretion: Inference Gleaned from Greenbook Forecasts and FOMC Decisions,"Michael T. Belongia, Peter N. Ireland",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12332,"From 1987 through 2013, the Federal Open Market Committee appears to have set its federal funds rate target with reference to Greenbook forecasts of the output gap and inflation and, at times, also to have made further adjustments to the funds rate as those forecasts were revised. If viewed in the context of the Taylor (1993) Rule, discretionary departures from the settings prescribed by Greenbook forecasts consistently presage business cycle turning points. Similarly, estimates from an interest rate rule with time‐varying parameters imply that, around such turning points, the FOMC responds less vigorously to information contained in Greenbook forecasts about the changing state of the economy. These results suggest possible gains from closer adherence to a rule with constant parameters."
41,Innovation and the Creative Destruction of Trade: A Study of the Intensive and Extensive Margins of Trade for French Firms,"Robert J. R. Elliott, Liza Jabbour, Enrico Vanino",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12324,"Our study of French exporters examines the causal relationship between innovation and extensive and intensive margins of trade using a propensity score matching and difference‐in‐differences approach. Results show innovation has a positive impact on total exports driven primarily through the intensive margin. To understand the absence of an extensive margin effect, we show new and terminated product–country transactions increase at similar rates in the year of innovation for the treated and control groups but net trade creation for innovators outstrips that of non‐innovators in the following two years implying firms need to innovate in order to survive in export markets."
42,Bias of OLS Estimators due to Exclusion of Relevant Variables and Inclusion of Irrelevant Variables,Deepankar Basu,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12322,"In this paper, I discuss three issues related to bias of OLS estimators in a general multivariate setting. First, I discuss the bias that arises from omitting relevant variables. I offer a geometric interpretation of such bias and derive sufficient conditions in terms of sign restrictions that allows us to determine the direction of bias. Second, I show that inclusion of some omitted variables will not necessarily reduce the magnitude of bias as long as some others remain omitted. Third, I show that inclusion of irrelevant variables in a model with omitted variables can also have an impact on the bias of OLS estimators. I use a running example of a simple wage regression to illustrate my arguments."
43,Simultaneous Diagnostic Testing for Nonlinear Time Series Models with An Application to the U.S. Federal Fund Rate,"Shuo Li, Bin Guo, Yundong Tu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12329,"This paper proposes a simultaneous test for the specification of the conditional mean and conditional variance functions as well as the error distribution in nonlinear time series models. Constructed by comparing two density estimators for the response variable, the proposed test has a Gumbel‐limiting distribution under the null hypothesis and is consistent against a general class of alternative hypotheses. A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed for practical implementation, and is shown to perform well in extensive simulations. The application to the continuous time diffusion model is illustrated via an analysis on the U.S. Federal fund rate data."
