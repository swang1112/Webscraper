1,Financial analyst coverage for U.S. firms facing foreign competition: Evidence from trade liberalization,"Dongyoung Lee, He Wen",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12111,"This study examines financial analyst coverage for U.S. firms following an increase in foreign product market competition. To capture exogenous shocks to domestic firms' competitive environments, we exploit a quasi‐natural experiment from large import tariff reductions over the 1984 to 2005 period in the manufacturing sector. Using data for the years before and after large tariff reductions, our difference‐in‐differences analysis shows evidence of a significant decrease in analyst coverage for incumbent U.S. firms when they face greater entry threat from foreign competitors. We also find that analysts with less firm‐specific experience and less accurate prior‐period forecasts are more likely to stop following the domestic firm when foreign competition intensifies. Overall, the findings suggest that foreign product market competition from global trade liberalization is an important determinant of financial analysts' coverage decisions."
2,The impact of accounting reform on accounting quality: Evidence from Nigeria,"Zayyad Abdul‐Baki, Roszaini Haniffa",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12112,"The effectiveness of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is dependent on the strength of enforcement of accounting standards in a given country. This study explores the implications of the adoption of IFRS in Nigeria after the enforcement of accounting standards was strengthened. The strengthening of accounting standards enforcement, and the subsequent adoption of IFRS in Nigeria, was recommended by the World Bank to improve the country's regulatory outlook after a capital market crisis in 2007/2008 that was triggered by widespread accounting irregularities. Results indicate that accounting quality declined in Nigeria following the adoption of IFRS; while earnings management increased, timely loss recognition and earnings persistence reduced. Our study contributes to the burgeoning literature on IFRS adoption and concludes that the effect of IFRS adoption is contextual. Therefore, accounting regulatory institutions operating in a similar context to Nigeria should localize IFRS."
3,Integrated reporting and cost of capital: The moderating role of cultural dimensions,"Luigi Vena, Salvatore Sciascia, Alessandro Cortesi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12113,"Since its introduction, integrated reporting (IR) has triggered a rich debate covering several aspects, from the structure and the features of a document to the effects of its publication. Very recently, scholars have examined the negative relationship between IR and the cost of capital for firms, completely missing the opportunity to understand whether this fact is contingent on the cultural context that adopting companies operate in. We fill this gap by resorting to a panel sample of 211 adopters from 31 countries over the period spanning 2009–2017, counting 1,455 observations. Our evidence confirms that adopters, on average, benefit from a 1.4% decrease in the cost of capital. Yet, more importantly, IR effectiveness is exalted in countries with low power distance, strong collectivism values, and high level of masculinity, while uncertainty avoidance, long‐term orientation, and indulgence do not seem to play any moderating role."
4,The perceived financial effects of mandatory audit firm rotation,"Michael Harber, Ben Marx, Phillip De Jager",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12115,"This paper explores the perceptions of key audit industry stakeholders concerning the direct and indirect financial effects of the implementation of mandatory audit firm rotation (MAFR) in South Africa. Globally, concerns over audit quality, in response to corporate failures, have resulted in renewed debate over MAFR as a solution. The European Union and South Africa have recently ruled in its favor, while other countries have rejected it on grounds that the benefits do not exceed the costs. Using structured surveys, the informed perspectives of experienced auditors, chief financial officers, audit committee chairs, and equity fund managers are explored and contrasted. We find that considerable costs will be imposed on audit firms in the form of “setup and transition costs,” as well as costs incurred to submit and present competitive tenders to secure appointment. Although auditors will try to recoup these costs with fee increases, this will likely not be allowed by the clients, resulting in a squeeze of audit firm profits. The Big 4 firm fee premium, relative to non‐Big 4 firms, will decrease due to increased competition. From the clients' perspective, the costs will be in the form of audit inefficiency translating into staff time and disruption, caused by the incoming auditors being less familiar with the complexities of the business. We contribute to the literature detailed descriptions and estimations of the nature and extent of potential cost implications, as expressed by experienced practitioners. The findings inform audit industry regulators, standard‐setters, and practitioners to more effectively mitigate potential unintended consequences of the regulation."

6,The pricing accuracy of alternative equity valuation models: Scandinavian evidence,"Sebastian Anesten, Niclas Möller, Kenth Skogsvik, Stina Skogsvik",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12097,"In many decision contexts, there is a need for benchmark equity valuations, based on simplified modeling and publicly available information. Prior research on U.S. data however shows that the accuracy of such valuation models can be low and sensitive to the choice of model specifications and value driver predictions. In this paper, we test the applicability and pricing accuracy of three fundamental valuation (dividend discount, residual income, and abnormal earnings growth) models, all based on forecasts of company dividends, earnings, and/or equity book values. Extending prior research, we apply these models to Scandinavian firms with accounting data from the period 2005–2014, explicitly testing two approaches for the prediction of the value drivers—exogenously forecasted numbers versus projected historical numbers. Given access to the forecasted value drivers, the dividend discount model comes out as the most accurate valuation model. In particular, this holds in a comparison between the most parsimonious model specifications. The residual income valuation model generates the best pricing accuracy given the prediction of value drivers based on historical financial numbers. Notably, we observe pricing errors that in general are lower than what has been reported in prior U.S.‐based research for the dividend discount and the residual income valuation models. The pricing accuracy of the abnormal earnings growth models is surprisingly weak in the Scandinavian setting. However, these models improve somewhat after a couple of complexity adjustments, in particular with value driver predictions based on the projected history setting."
7,Audit firm tenure and audit quality: A cross‐European study,"Josep Garcia‐Blandon, Josep Maria Argilés‐Bosch, Diego Ravenda",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12098,"Directive 2014/56/EU and Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, which came into effect in June 2016, introduced the mandatory rotation of audit firms after a maximum period of 10 years with the same client. We conduct a cross‐European study with the aim of assessing whether long audit firm tenures are associated with lower levels of audit quality. The sample for the study is based on the constituents of the Standard & Poor's Europe 350 index for the years between 2009 and 2016, and we utilize three different sets of proxies for audit quality: discretionary accruals, differences between reported earnings and earnings benchmarks, and accounting restatements. The main result of the study finds that companies with more than 10 years of tenure with their auditors do not have a lower audit quality than other firms. In fact, this study provides some evidence of a higher audit quality for these firms. The results are robust to various checks. Therefore, if there does not seem to be a problem of a lack of audit quality associated with long audit firm tenures, the necessity of establishing a maximum tenure, as the new European regulation does, may be questioned."
8,Does audit report information improve financial distress prediction over Altman's traditional Z‐Score model?,"Nora Muñoz‐Izquierdo, Erkki K. Laitinen, María‐del‐Mar Camacho‐Miñano, David Pascual‐Ezama",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12110,"We analyze empirically the usefulness of combining accounting and auditing data in order to predict corporate financial distress. Concretely, we examine whether audit report information incrementally predicts distress over a traditional accounting model: the Altman's Z‐Score model. Although the audit report seems to play a critical part in financial distress prediction because auditors should warn investors about any default risks, this is the first study that uses audit report disclosures for predicting purposes. From a dataset of 1,821 Spanish distressed private firms, we analyze a sample of distressed and non‐distressed firms and develop logit prediction models. Our results show that while the only accounting model registers a classification accuracy of 77%, combined models of accounting and auditing data exhibit considerably higher accuracy (about 87%). Specifically, our findings indicate that the number of disclosures included in the audit report, as well as disclosures related to a firm's going concern status, firms’ assets, and firms’ recognition of revenues and expenses contribute the most to the prediction. Our empirical evidence has implications for financial distress practice. For managers, our study highlights the importance of audit report disclosures for anticipating a financial distress situation. For regulators and auditors, our study underscores the importance of recent changes in regulation worldwide intended to increase auditor's transparency through a more informative audit report."
9,How do the ownership structure and board of directors' features impact earnings management? The Spanish case,"Paolo Saona, Laura Muro, María Alvarado",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jifm.12114,"This paper examines how the ownership structure and board of directors' features determine the managerial opportunistic behavior exemplified in the management of accounting earnings. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship of firm‐level and country‐level corporate governance systems on the earnings management in the Spanish corporate sector. Results reveal that the varying efficiency of the corporate governance systems is reflected in the way in which accounting discretion is performed. We found evidence that earnings management is reduced as the voting rights of the controlling shareholder increased and that there is an inverse U‐shaped relationship between insiders' ownership and the earnings manipulation. Regarding the board characteristics, we observe that larger, independent boards, those with a larger proportion of female members, and those with an audit committee compounded by a greater proportion of outside independent directors oversee managers more efficiently, constraining their capacity to manage earnings. To the contrary, board duality increases the likelihood of opportunistic manipulation of financial reporting. We found that when the institutional environment improves in the Spanish context, the discretionary power of the corporate sector to overstate the financial statements is reduced. The findings prove the necessity of reinforcing the rules and regulations toward a more transparent disclosure of the financial statements."
