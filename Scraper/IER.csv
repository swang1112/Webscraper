1,STATE DEPENDENCE IN LABOR MARKET FLUCTUATIONS,"Carlo Pizzinelli, Konstantinos Theodoridis, Francesco Zanetti",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12448,"This article documents state dependence in labor market fluctuations. Using a Threshold Vector Autoregression (TVAR) model, we establish that the unemployment rate, the job separation rate, and the job‐finding rate (JFR) exhibit a larger response to productivity shocks during periods with low aggregate productivity. A Diamond–Mortensen–Pissarides model with endogenous job separation and on‐the‐job search replicates these empirical regularities well. We calibrate the model to match the standard deviation of the job‐transition rates explained by productivity shocks in the TVAR, and show that the model explains 88% of the state dependence in the unemployment rate, 76% for the separation rate and 36% for the JFR. The key channel underpinning state dependence in both job separation and JFRs is the interaction of the firm's reservation productivity level and the distribution of match‐specific idiosyncratic productivity. Results are robust across several variations to the baseline model."
2,REDISTRIBUTION AND FISCAL UNCERTAINTY SHOCKS,Hikaru Saijo,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12449,"This article studies the impact of fiscal uncertainty shocks. In micro data, noncapital holders reduce consumption persistently in response to an increase in fiscal uncertainty whereas capital holders do not. Motivated by this evidence, I introduce limited capital market participation and show that it magnifies the fall in economic activity due to a fiscal uncertainty shock and induces macroeconomic comovement. This is because the limited participation model captures individual uncertainty about redistribution. When agents are ambiguity averse, this uncertainty about redistribution has first‐order effects. As a result, the model successfully matches the empirical responses of macro and household variables."
3,THE PROPAGATION OF UNCERTAINTY SHOCKS: ROTEMBERG VERSUS CALVO,Joonseok Oh,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12450,"This article studies the effects of uncertainty shocks on economic activity, focusing on inflation. Using a vector autoregression, I show that increased uncertainty has negative demand effects, reducing GDP and prices. I then consider standard New Keynesian models with Rotemberg‐type and Calvo‐type price rigidities. Despite the belief that the two schemes are equivalent, I show that they generate different dynamics in response to uncertainty shocks. In the Rotemberg model, uncertainty shocks decrease output and inflation, in line with the empirical results. By contrast, in the Calvo model, uncertainty shocks decrease output but raise inflation because of firms' precautionary pricing motive."
4,EXISTENCE OF STATIONARY EQUILIBRIUM IN AN INCOMPLETE‐MARKET MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS LABOR SUPPLY,Shenghao Zhu,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12451,"In this article, I first study an income fluctuation problem with endogenous labor supply. Let β be the agent's time discount factor and  be the constant gross rate of return on assets. For , I show that the agent's wealth either approaches infinity almost surely or converges to a finite level almost surely. For , I prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the stationary distribution of state variables. I then show the existence of the stationary general equilibrium in an incomplete‐market model with endogenous labor supply."
5,DECENTRALIZED ONE‐TO‐MANY BARGAINING,"Chiu Yu Ko, Duozhe Li",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12452,"We study a one‐to‐many bargaining model in which one active player bargains with every passive player on how to share the surplus of a joint project. The order of bargaining is not fixed and the active player decides whom to bargain with in each period. Our model admits a rich set of equilibria and we identify the upper and lower bounds of equilibrium payoffs. We also examine whether two natural ordering protocols often assumed in existing studies can sustain endogenously. Although the queuing protocol may indeed arise in an equilibrium, the rotating protocol is in general not self‐enforcing."
6,EXTREMIST PLATFORMS: POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF PROFIT‐SEEKING MEDIA,"Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay, Kalyan Chatterjee, Jaideep Roy",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12453,"We analyze how information about candidate quality affects the choice of electoral platforms made by an office‐motivated political challenger. The incumbent is of known quality and located at the ideal policy of the voter. The voter cares for both policy and the candidates' quality and can learn about the challenger's quality by buying information. A high‐quality challenger then has an incentive to signal her quality by choosing a policy that induces the voter to buy information. We first study the benchmark case in which the information is supplied exogenously, and its quality is independent of the challenger's platform; this yields multiple equilibria and indeterminacy of equilibrium platforms. By contrast, when the information is supplied by a profit‐maximizing media outlet, its quality depends on the challenger's platform and we obtain a unique equilibrium platform. In particular, when the incumbent's quality is relatively low, the media coverage rises and the challenger's platform diverges further from the voter's ideal policy as the voter's preference for quality increases."
7,ENDOGENOUS SOURCES OF VOLATILITY IN HOUSING MARKETS: THE JOINT BUYER–SELLER PROBLEM,"Elliot Anenberg, Patrick Bayer",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12454,"This article presents new empirical evidence that internal movement—selling one home and buying another—by existing homeowners within a metropolitan housing market is especially volatile and a substantial driver of fluctuations in transaction volume over the housing market cycle. We develop a search model that shows that the strong procyclicality of internal movement is driven by the cost of simultaneously holding two homes, which varies endogenously over the cycle. The estimated model shows that frictions related to this joint buyer–seller problem substantially amplify cyclical price volatility in housing markets."
8,"DISCOUNT SHOCK, PRICE–RENT DYNAMICS, AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE","Jianjun Miao, Pengfei Wang, Tao Zha",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12455,"The price‐rent ratio in commercial real estate is highly volatile and its variation comoves with the business cycle. To account for these facts, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model that introduces a rental market and incorporates the liquidity constraint on an individual firm's production as a key ingredient. Our estimation identifies the discount shock as the most important factor in driving price‐rent dynamics and linking the dynamics in the real estate market to those in the real economy. We illustrate the importance of the liquidity premium and endogenous TFP in the nexus of the financial and real sectors."
9,THE HIDDEN COST OF BARGAINING: EVIDENCE FROM A CHEATING‐PRONE MARKETPLACE,"Haimanti Bhattacharya, Subhasish Dugar",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12456,It is widely believed that successful bargaining helps consumers increase their surplus. We present evidence from a field experiment showing that bargaining over price reduces buyer surplus in a marketplace where sellers cheat on the weight whose value may more than offset the price discount. Our results show that bargaining entails hidden costs since sellers cheat significantly more when buyers bargain than not and they cheat significantly more when bargaining succeeds than fails. Overall bargaining reduces buyer surplus than not bargaining. Our result is relevant for credence goods markets where bargaining over prices may induce sellers to “undertreat” more.
10,PLATFORM COMPETITION WITH ENDOGENOUS HOMING,"Thomas D. Jeitschko, Mark J. Tremblay",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12457,"We consider two‐sided markets in which consumers and firms endogenously determine whether they single‐home, multi‐home, or exit the market. We find that the competitive bottleneck allocation in which consumers single‐home and firms multi‐home is always an equilibrium. In addition, we find equilibria with multi‐homing and single‐homing on each side of the market. However, unlike the standard pricing result where the side that multi‐homes faces higher prices, we find that lower prices coincide with multi‐homing: agents find multi‐homing more attractive when faced with lower prices. We also show that endogenous homing can induce straddle pricing which deters price undercutting between platforms."
11,ADVERSE SELECTION WITH HETEROGENEOUSLY INFORMED AGENTS,Seyed Mohammadreza Davoodalhosseini,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12458,"A model of over‐the‐counter markets is proposed. Some asset buyers are informed in that they can identify high‐quality assets. Sellers with private information choose what type of buyers they want to trade with. When the measure of informed buyers is low, a unique equilibrium exists, and interestingly, price, trading volume and welfare typically decrease with more informed buyers. When the measure of informed buyers is intermediate, multiple equilibria arise. A switch from one equilibrium to another can lead to large drops in liquidity, price, trading volume, and welfare, like a financial crisis. Implications of an endogenous measure of informed buyers are also studied."
12,BUFFER‐STOCK SAVING AND HOUSEHOLDS' RESPONSE TO INCOME SHOCKS,"Giulio Fella, Serafin Frache, Winfried Koeniger",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12459,"We exploit information on the joint dynamics of household labor income, consumption, and wealth in the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth to structurally estimate a buffer‐stock saving model. We compare the degree of consumption smoothing implied by the model to the corresponding empirical estimates based on the same data set. We estimate that Italian households smooth 12% of permanent income shocks in the data that is comparable to the model counterpart of 11% . This result contrasts with existing evidence, and our own findings in this article, of substantially more consumption smoothing in U.S. data."

15,REVEALED PREFERENCE AND ACTIVITY RULES IN DYNAMIC AUCTIONS,"Lawrence M. Ausubel, Oleg Baranov",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12431,"Activity rules—constraints that limit bidding in future rounds based on past bids—are intended to limit strategic bidding delays in high‐stakes auctions. This article provides a general treatment of activity rules. Traditional point‐based rules are effective for homogeneous goods and reasonably suited for substitute goods. However, they are simultaneously too strong and too weak for general environments; they allow parking, while sometimes preventing straightforward bidding. We prove that the activity rule operationalizing the generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP) is essentially the unique rule that enforces the Law of Demand while enabling straightforward bidding and never producing “dead ends.”"
16,SYSTEMATIC MONETARY POLICY AND THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SHIFTS IN RESIDENTIAL LOAN‐TO‐VALUE RATIOS,"Rüdiger Bachmann, Sebastian K. Rüth",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12432,"What are the macroeconomic consequences of changing aggregate lending standards in residential mortgage markets, as measured by loan‐to‐value (LTV) ratios? Using a structural vector autoregression (VAR), we find that GDP and business investment increase following an expansionary LTV shock. Residential investment, by contrast, falls after a small initial uptick, a result that depends on the systematic reaction of monetary policy. We show that, historically, the Fed tended to respond to expansionary LTV shocks by raising the monetary policy instrument, and, as a result, mortgage rates increased and residential investment declined. House prices are affected in a similar manner."
17,IMMUNITY,"Karthik Reddy, Moritz Schularick, Vasiliki Skreta",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12433,"Legal provisions that protect elected politicians from prosecution have been common throughout history and still exist in most democracies. We provide the first systematic measurement of immunity and study, theoretically and empirically, its relation to corruption. Theory predicts that immunity is a double‐edged sword. To test whether immunity is a vice or a virtue, we quantify immunity enjoyed by heads of government, ministers, and legislators in 90 countries. Controlling for standard determinants of corruption, we find that stronger immunity is associated with greater corruption. Instrumental variable estimations using immunity at the first democratic constitution suggest the effect could be causal."
18,A COMMENT ON “ESTIMATING DYNAMIC DISCRETE CHOICE MODELS WITH HYPERBOLIC DISCOUNTING” BY HANMING FANG AND YANG WANG,"Jaap H. Abbring, Øystein Daljord",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12434,"Fang and Wang's (2015) Proposition 2 claims generic identification of a dynamic discrete choice model with hyperbolic discounting under exclusion restrictions. We note that Proposition 2 uses a definition of “generic” that does not preclude that a generically identified model is nowhere identified. We provide two examples of models that are generically identified under this definition, but that are, respectively, everywhere and nowhere identified. We then show that the proof of Proposition 2 is incorrect and incomplete. We conclude that Proposition 2 has no implications for identification of the dynamic discrete choice model and suggest alternative approaches to its identification."
19,HOME EQUITY IN RETIREMENT,"Makoto Nakajima, Irina A. Telyukova",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12435,"Retired homeowners dissave more slowly than renters, which suggests that homeownership affects retirees' saving decisions. We investigate empirically and theoretically the life‐cycle patterns of homeownership, housing, and nonhousing assets in retirement. Using an estimated structural model of saving and housing decisions, we find first that homeowners dissave slowly because they prefer to stay in their house as long as possible but cannot easily borrow against it. Second, the 1996–2006 housing boom significantly increased homeowners' assets. These channels are quantitatively significant; without considering homeownership, retirees' net worth would be 28%–44% lower, depending on age."
20,ENTREPRENEURSHIP OVER THE LIFE CYCLE: WHERE ARE THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS?,Andrés Hincapié,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12436,"Most individuals do not start a business and, if they do, they start well into their 30s. To explain these stylized facts, I estimate a dynamic Roy model with experience accumulation, risk aversion, and imperfect information about ability using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Information frictions and income risk reduce entrepreneurship by up to 40% and 35%, respectively. Entry costs and information frictions explain most of the delayed entry. Results from counterfactual policies targeting delayed entry suggest that entrepreneurship education can yield higher returns than subsidies. Fostering young entrepreneurship yields higher returns than fostering old entrepreneurship."
21,INNOVATION AND INEQUALITY IN A SMALL WORLD,"Ines Lindner, Holger Strulik",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12437,"We present a multicountry theory of economic growth and R&D‐driven technological progress in which countries are connected by a network of knowledge exchange. Technological progress in any country depends on the state of technology in the countries it exchanges knowledge with. The diffusion of knowledge throughout the world explains a period of increasing world inequality, followed by decreasing relative inequality. Knowledge diffusion through a small world network produces an extraordinary diversity of country growth performances, including the overtaking of individual countries and the replacement of the technologically leading country in the course of world development."
22,UNIQUE MARKOV EQUILIBRIUM UNDER LIMITED COMMITMENT,Gaetano Bloise,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12438,"I develop a recursive method for the characterization of competitive equilibrium under limited commitment with not‐too‐tight solvency constraints. The reputational mechanism is fragile, as it sustains constrained efficiency as well as a large set of constrained inefficient equilibria. However, I establish that the only strongly ergodic Markov equilibrium with trade is constrained efficient. The method relies on a planning program along with the theory of monotone concave operators. It is suitable for other applications to macroeconomics and dynamic contracts."
23,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLES IN EMERGING MARKETS,Jacek Rothert,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12439,"I document cyclical behavior of real exchange rates (RERs) in emerging and developed economies: stronger RER procyclicality coincides with larger relative volatility of consumption and more countercyclical trade balance. I then reevaluate the sources of fluctuations in emerging economies using an international business cycle model estimated to match the behavior of the RERs. Interest rate shocks, without any frictions, account for most of output fluctuations. This result is driven by imperfect substitution between domestic and foreign goods, which dampens the impact of trend shocks and accentuates the impact of interest rate shocks on output and consumption."
24,GIRLS' SCHOOLING CHOICES AND HOME PRODUCTION: EVIDENCE FROM PAKISTAN,Hugo Reis,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12440,"The article develops and estimates a dynamic structural model of girls' school‐going decisions and mother's labor market participation. It seeks to determine the causes of low school participation and to evaluate alternative public policies. The model incorporates mother's education, school availability, the productivity of the girl when engaged in household production, and the potential trade‐off between mother's and daughter's housework decisions. Our findings suggest that school construction is the most cost‐effective program. When using monetary incentives, our results highlight the effectiveness of conditionality, as opposed to unconditional transfers, and the existence of a trade‐off between maternal employment and daughter's schooling."
25,RENOVATIO MONETAE: WHEN GESELL TAXES WORKED,"Roger Svensson, Andreas Westermark",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12441,"Gesell taxes on money have recently received attention as a way of alleviating the zero lower bound on interest rates. Less known is that such taxes generated seigniorage in medieval Europe for around two centuries. When a Gesell tax was levied, current coins ceased to be legal and had to be exchanged into new coins for a fee. Using a cash‐in‐advance model, we analyze under what conditions agents exchange coins and the tax generates revenues. A low exchange fee, high punishments for using old coins, and a long time period between re‐mintings induce people to use new coins."
26,APPROXIMATING PURCHASE PROPENSITIES AND RESERVATION PRICES FROM BROAD CONSUMER TRACKING,Benjamin Reed Shiller,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12442,"A consumer's web‐browsing history, now readily available, may be much more useful than demographics for both targeting advertisements and personalizing prices. Using a method that combines economic modeling and machine learning methods, I find a striking difference. Personalizing prices based on web‐browsing histories increases profits by 12.99%. Using demographics alone to personalize prices raises profits by only 0.25%, suggesting the percent profit gain from personalized pricing has increased 50‐fold. I then investigate whether regulations intended to prevent price gouging increase aggregate consumer surplus. Two feasible regulations considered offer at best modest improvements."
27,INFORMATION AND PRICE DISPERSION: THEORY AND EVIDENCE,"Dieter Pennerstorfer, Philipp Schmidt‐Dengler, Nicolas Schutz, Christoph Weiss, Biliana Yontcheva",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12443,"Limited information is the key element generating price dispersion in models of homogeneous‐goods markets. We show that the global relationship between information and price dispersion is an inverse‐U shape. We test this mechanism for the retail gasoline market using a new measure of information based on commuter data from Austria. Commuters sample gasoline prices on their commuting route, providing us with spatial variation in the share of informed consumers. Our empirical estimates are in line with the theoretical predictions. We also quantify how information affects average prices paid and the distribution of surplus in the gasoline market."
28,NEGOTIATED BLOCK TRADE AND REBUILDING OF TRUST,"Pak Hung Au, Yuk‐Fai Fong, Jin Li",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12444,"We investigate the impact of corporate governance on customers' trust using a dynamic model of experience‐goods firm. In the optimal equilibrium, customers' trust in the firm is linked to its behavior in the market for corporate control, so that the controlling shareholder has incentives to ensure high product quality while noncontrolling shareholders' interests are protected. Following a trust‐damaging event, turnover of the controlling share block restores customers' trust and enhances total shareholder value. Our analysis identifies an endogenous cost of corporate control, offers implications for the control premium, and provides a novel rationale for the separation of ownership and control."
29,IMMIGRANT WAGE GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES: THE ROLE OF OCCUPATIONAL UPGRADING,"Rebecca Lessem, Carl Sanders",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12445,"Immigrants to the United States routinely take jobs below their skill qualifications because of barriers to entering occupations. We use a structural model of immigrant job choice to quantify the benefits of potential policies to promote entry into suitable occupations. We estimate the model using longitudinal labor market data on immigrants to the United States. Our counterfactual results show that eliminating barriers to occupational entry would lead to only a small earnings increase for the average immigrant in our sample, but a substantial earnings increase for the most highly skilled immigrants."
30,PANEL DATA HEDONICS: ROSEN'S FIRST STAGE AS A “SUFFICIENT STATISTIC”,H. Spencer Banzhaf,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12446,"Traditional cross‐sectional estimates of hedonic price functions can recover marginal willingness to pay for characteristics, but face endogeneity problems for estimating nonmarginal welfare measures. This article shows that when panel data on household demands are available, one can construct a second‐order approximation to nonmarginal welfare measures using only the first‐stage marginal prices. With repeated cross sections of product prices, the measure can be set identified or, under a single‐crossing restriction, point identified. Bounds also can be constructed when there are mobility costs. Finally, a variant remains valid when individual preferences shift over time."
31,CONTROLLING INFLATION WITH TIMID MONETARY–FISCAL REGIME CHANGES,"Guido Ascari, Anna Florio, Alessandro Gobbi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12447,"Can monetary policy control inflation when both monetary and fiscal policies change over time? When monetary policy is active, a long‐run fiscal principle entails flexibility in fiscal policy that preserves determinacy even when deviating from passive fiscal, substantially for brief periods or timidly for prolonged periods. In order to guarantee a unique equilibrium, monetary and fiscal policies must coordinate not only within but also across regimes, and not simply on being active or passive, but also on their extent. The amplitude of deviations from the active monetary/passive fiscal benchmark determines whether a regime is Ricardian: Timid deviations do not imply wealth effects."

33,SECRET SEARCH,"Andrew John, Ian King",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12415,"For high‐profile positions, should applicant identities be made public within the organization (“open search”) or kept confidential (“secret search”)? We construct a model where an organization seeks to hire, but where candidates' abilities are private information unless it uses open search. Rejected applicants, under open search, suffer disutility. We find the following: Salaries are lower under secret search, the expected ability of applicants decreases as the posted (open search) salary increases, secret search is preferred by organizations where quality of candidate is relatively unimportant, and organizations will, for some parameter values, choose secret search even when open search is more efficient."
34,STICKY PRICES AND COSTLY CREDIT,"Liang Wang, Randall Wright, Lucy Qian Liu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12416,"We develop a theory of money and credit as competing payment instruments, then put it to work in applications. Agents use cash and credit because the former (latter) is subject to the inflation tax (transaction costs). Frictions that make the choice of payment method interesting also imply equilibrium price dispersion. We derive closed‐form solutions for money demand, and show how to simultaneously account for the price‐change facts, cash–credit shares in micro data, and money‐interest correlations in macro data. The effects of inflation on welfare, price dispersion and markups are discussed, as are nonstationary equilibria with dynamics in the price distribution."
35,"HOUSEHOLD SAVING, FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS, AND THE CURRENT ACCOUNT IN CHINA","Ayşe İmrohoroğlu, Kai Zhao",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12417,"In this article, we present a model that can account for the changes in the current account balance in China since the 2000s. Our results suggest that inadequate insurance through government programs for the elderly and the decline in family insurance due to the one‐child policy led to large increases in the household saving rate. These increases coupled with the financial frictions preventing the household saving from being invested in domestic firms resulted in large current account surpluses until 2008. Relaxation of financial constraints, on the other hand, was responsible for the decline in the current account surplus after 2008."
36,DETECTING AND ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF TIME‐VARYING PARAMETERS IN DSGE MODELS,"Fabio Canova, Filippo Ferroni, Christian Matthes",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12418,"We study how structural parameter variations affect the decision rules and economic inference. We provide diagnostics to detect parameter variations and to ascertain whether they are exogenous or endogenous. A constant parameter model poorly approximates a time‐varying data generating process (DGP), except in a handful of relevant cases. Linear approximations do not produce time‐varying decision rules; higher‐order approximations can do this only if parameter disturbances are treated as decision rule coefficients. Structural responses are time invariant regardless of order of approximation. Adding endogenous variations to the parameter controlling leverage in Gertler and Karadi's model substantially improves the fit of the model."
37,URBAN POPULATION AND AMENITIES: THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL OF LOCATION,"David Albouy, Bryan A. Stuart",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12419,"We develop a neoclassical general equilibrium model to explain cross‐metro variation in population and density. We provide new methods to estimate traded and nontraded productivities, and elasticities of housing and land supply, using density and land area data. From wage and housing cost indices, the model explains half of U.S. density and population variation and finds that quality of life determines location choices more than trade productivity; productivity and factor substitution in housing matter most, but are weak in nicer areas. Relaxing land use regulations would increase population in the West, raising both quality of life and productivity experienced by residents."
38,INVESTIGATING NONNEUTRALITY IN A STATE‐DEPENDENT PRICING MODEL WITH FIRM‐LEVEL PRODUCTIVITY SHOCKS,"Michael Dotsey, Alexander L. Wolman",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12420,"In a model with fixed cost of price adjustment and idiosyncratic shocks, two parameterizations match a large set of microeconomic facts, yet display different degrees of nonneutrality. Although there is substantial nonneutrality in both cases, the model does not behave like a time‐dependent model, as changes in the distribution of firms account for roughly a third of the short‐run response of the price level to a monetary shock. We use the model to examine how aggregating firm behavior can generate flat hazards; we also find that a recently developed steady‐state statistic is an imperfect guide to characterizing nonneutrality."
39,JUST A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING? BIAS AND BAYESIAN AFFECTIVE POLARIZATION,Daniel F. Stone,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12421,"I present a model of affective polarization—growth in hostility over time between two parties—via quasi‐Bayesian inference. In the model, two agents repeatedly choose actions. Each choice is based on a balance of concerns for private interests and the social good. More weight is put on private interests when an agent's character is intrinsically more self‐serving and when the other agent is believed to be more self‐serving. Each agent Bayesian updates about the other's character, and dislikes the other more when she is perceived as more self‐serving. I characterize the effects on growth in dislike of three biases: a prior bias against the other agent's character, the false consensus bias, and limited strategic thinking. Prior bias against the other's character remains constant or declines over time, and actions do not diverge. The other two biases cause actions to become more extreme over time and repeatedly be “worse” than expected, causing mutual growth in dislike, that is, affective polarization. The magnitude of dislike can become arbitrarily large—even when both players are arbitrarily “good” (unselfish). The results imply that seemingly irrelevant cognitive biases can be an important cause of the devolution of relationships, in politics and beyond, and that subtlety and unawareness of bias can be key factors driving the degree of polarization."
40,SOCIAL INSURANCE AND OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY,"German Cubas, Pedro Silos",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12422,"This article studies how insurance from progressive taxation improves the matching of workers to occupations. We propose an equilibrium dynamic assignment model to illustrate how social insurance encourages mobility. Workers experiment to find their best occupational fit in a process filled with uncertainty. Risk aversion and limited earnings insurance induce workers to remain in unfitting occupations. We estimate the model using microdata from the United States and Germany. Higher earnings uncertainty explains the U.S. higher mobility rate. When workers in the United States enjoy Germany's higher progressivity, mobility rises. Output and welfare gains are large."
41,THE FORMATION OF CONSUMER INFLATION EXPECTATIONS: NEW EVIDENCE FROM JAPAN'S DEFLATION EXPERIENCE,"Jess Diamond, Kota Watanabe, Tsutomu Watanabe",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12423,"Using a new data set, we investigate the relationship between the inflation experience and expectations of households in Japan, focusing on the post‐1995 deflationary era. Our first finding is that inflation expectations increase with age. Second, we find that measured inflation rates also increase with age, although age and inflation expectations continue to exhibit a positive correlation even after controlling for the household‐level inflation rate. Analysis suggests that the correlation between age and inflation expectations is driven largely by the correlation between cohort and inflation expectations, which we interpret to represent the effect of historical inflation experience on inflation expectations."
42,EXPLORING THE CONSISTENCY OF HIGHER ORDER RISK PREFERENCES,"Alexander Haering, Timo Heinrich, Thomas Mayrhofer",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12424,"This study measures higher order risk preferences and their consistency. We explore the role of country differences, the variation of stakes, and the framing of lotteries. We observe a robust dichotomous pattern of choice behavior in China, the United States, and Germany. The majority of choices are consistent with mixed risk aversion or mixed risk‐loving behavior. We also find this pattern after a 10‐fold increase in the stakes. Finally, our results reveal that this pattern is strengthened if the lotteries are displayed in compound instead of reduced form. In a follow‐up study, we explore potential explanations for this framing effect."
43,WORK HISTORIES AND LIFETIME UNEMPLOYMENT,Iacopo Morchio,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12425,"A long‐standing question in economics is how important unobserved differences across workers are for explaining unemployment. I revisit this topic using variation in lifetime unemployment across workers in U.S. data. A comparison of workers often unemployed with the rest shows that although differences in job‐finding rates increase over the course of a career, differences in job‐separation rates are large right from the start. I develop a directed search model with symmetric unobserved heterogeneity, in which agents learn workers' types from their labor market histories, to rationalize these findings. The model cannot match the data if unobserved heterogeneity is neglected."
44,"DYNAMIC STATUS EFFECTS, SAVINGS, AND INCOME INEQUALITY","Evangelos V. Dioikitopoulos, Stephen J. Turnovsky, Ronald Wendner",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12426,"This article advances the hypothesis that the intensity of status preferences depends negatively on the average wealth of society (endogenous dynamic status effect), in accordance with empirical evidence. Our theory replicates the contradictory historical facts of an increasing saving rate along with declining returns to capital over time. By affecting the dynamics of the saving rate, the dynamic status effect raises inequality, thereby providing a behavioral mechanism for the observed diverse dynamics of income inequality across countries. In countries in which the dynamic status effect is strong (weak), inequality rises (declines) over time in response to a positive productivity shock."

Using administrative data from the quasi‐universe of firms, we show that there was an increase in misallocation, which was more severe in sectors where connections with public officials are more important for business success. We write and estimate a simple model of cronyism in which heterogeneous firms invest in political connections. Our quantitative exercise concludes that the institutional decline over this period costed 1.9% growth in TFP per year and a 0.8% annual increase in the resources spent by firms in establishing political connections."
46,AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF COOPERATION IN THE DYNAMIC COMMON POOL GAME,Emanuel Vespa,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12428,"This article studies experimentally to what extent subjects can cooperate in a dynamic common pool game, where the stage game changes endogenously. Although efficiency can be supported with strategies that condition on history, the main finding is that it is difficult to cooperate. Even if the incentives to cooperate are large, modal behavior can be rationalized with equilibrium Markov strategies that do not condition on history. The popularity of Markov strategies, however, is decreasing in the incentives to cooperate. The evidence also suggests that strategic uncertainty added by facing stage games that change in time may move play away from efficiency."
47,SELLING IN ADVANCE TO LOSS AVERSE CONSUMERS,"Heiko Karle, Marc Möller",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iere.12429,"This article examines the influence of information on market performance in an advance purchase setting. Information reduces the risk that an advance purchase results in a mismatch between consumer preferences and product characteristics. However, information may also raise the number of advance purchases by increasing firms' incentive to offer advance purchase discounts. Accounting for consumers' aversion toward losses/risks turns out to be crucial as it changes our assessment of policies aiming to improve consumers' information: Under monopoly, information can be detrimental both for efficiency and consumer surplus, whereas under competition, information is doubly beneficial because it mitigates intertemporal business stealing."
