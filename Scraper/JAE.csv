1,Prediction regions for interval‐valued time series,"Gloria Gonzalez‐Rivera, Yun Luo, Esther Ruiz",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2754,"We approximate probabilistic forecasts for interval‐valued time series by offering alternative approaches. After fitting a possibly non‐Gaussian bivariate vector autoregression (VAR) model to the center/log‐range system, we transform prediction regions (analytical and bootstrap) for this system into regions for center/range and upper/lower bounds systems. Monte Carlo simulations show that bootstrap methods are preferred according to several new metrics. For daily S&P 500 low/high returns, we build joint conditional prediction regions of the return level and volatility. We illustrate the usefulness of obtaining bootstrap forecasts regions for low/high returns by developing a trading strategy and showing its profitability when compared to using point forecasts."
2,Comparing predictive accuracy in small samples using fixed‐smoothing asymptotics,"Laura Coroneo, Fabrizio Iacone",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2756,"We consider fixed‐smoothing asymptotics for the Diebold and Mariano (Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 1995, 13(3), 253–263) test of predictive accuracy. We show that this approach delivers predictive accuracy tests that are correctly sized even when only a small number of out‐of‐sample observations is available. We apply the fixed‐smoothing asymptotics to the Diebold and Mariano test to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and of the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters (ECB SPF) against a simple random walk. Our results show that the predictive abilities of the SPF and of the ECB SPF were partially spurious."
3,Exchange rate predictability and dynamic Bayesian learning,"Joscha Beckmann, Gary Koop, Dimitris Korobilis, Rainer Alexander Schüssler",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2761,"We consider how an investor in the foreign exchange market can exploit predictive information by means of flexible Bayesian inference. Using a variety of vector autoregressive models, the investor is able, each period, to learn about important data features. The developed methodology synthesizes a wide array of established approaches for modeling exchange rate dynamics. In a thorough investigation of monthly exchange rate predictability for 10 countries, we find that using the proposed methodology for dynamic asset allocation achieves substantial economic gains out of sample. In particular, we find evidence for sparsity, fast model switching, and exploitation of the exchange rate cross‐section."
4,Complementary Bayesian method of moments strategies,A. Ronald Gallant,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2758,Methodology is proposed that addresses two problems that arise in application of the generalized method of moments representation of the likelihood in Bayesian inference: (1) a missing Jacobian term and (2) a normality assumption. The proposals are illustrated by application to the seminal application of the generalized method of moments methodology in the econometric literature: an endowment economy whose representative agent has constant relative risk aversion utility.
5,Order‐invariant tests for proper calibration of multivariate density forecasts,"Jonas Dovern, Hans Manner",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2755,Established tests for proper calibration of multivariate density forecasts based on Rosenblatt probability integral transforms can be manipulated by changing the order of variables in the forecasting model. We derive order‐invariant tests. The new tests are applicable to densities of arbitrary dimensions and can deal with parameter estimation uncertainty and dynamic misspecification. Monte Carlo simulations show that they often have superior power relative to established approaches. We use the tests to evaluate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity‐based multivariate density forecasts for a vector of stock market returns and macroeconomic forecasts from a Bayesian vector autoregression with time‐varying parameters.
6,Estimation of firm‐level productivity in the presence of exports: Evidence from China's manufacturing,"Emir Malikov, Shunan Zhao, Subal C. Kumbhakar",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2757,"Motivated by the long‐standing interest of economists in understanding the nexus between firm productivity and export behavior, this paper develops a novel structural framework for control‐function‐based nonparametric identification of the gross production function and latent firm productivity in the presence of endogenous export opportunities that is robust to recent unidentification critiques of proxy estimators. We provide a workable identification strategy, whereby the firm's degree of export orientation provides the needed (excluded) relevant independent exogenous variation in endogenous freely varying inputs, thus allowing us to identify the production function. We estimate our fully nonparametric instrumental variable model using the Landweber–Fridman regularization with the unknown functions approximated via artificial neural network sieves with a sigmoid activation function, which are known for their superior performance relative to other popular sieve approximators, including the polynomial series favored in the literature. Using our methodology, we obtain robust productivity estimates for manufacturing firms from 28 industries in China during the 1999–2006 period to take a close look at China's exporter productivity puzzle, whereby exporters are found to exhibit lower productivity levels than nonexports."

8,Assessing international commonality in macroeconomic uncertainty and its effects,"Andrea Carriero, Todd E. Clark, Massimiliano Marcellino",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2750,"This paper uses a large vector autoregression to measure international macroeconomic uncertainty and its effects on major economies. We provide evidence of significant commonality in macroeconomic volatility, with one common factor driving strong comovement across economies and variables. We measure uncertainty and its effects with a large model in which the error volatilities feature a factor structure containing time‐varying global components and idiosyncratic components. Global uncertainty contemporaneously affects both the levels and volatilities of the included variables. Our new estimates of international macroeconomic uncertainty indicate that surprise increases in uncertainty reduce output and stock prices, adversely affect labor market conditions, and in some economies lead to an easing of monetary policy."
9,Common correlated effects estimation of heterogeneous dynamic panel quantile regression models,"Matthew Harding, Carlos Lamarche, M. Hashem Pesaran",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2753,This paper proposes a quantile regression estimator for a heterogeneous panel model with lagged dependent variables and interactive effects. The paper adopts the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) approach proposed in the literature and demonstrates that the extension to the estimation of dynamic quantile regression models is feasible under similar conditions to the ones used in the literature. The new quantile regression estimator is shown to be consistent and its asymptotic distribution is derived. Monte Carlo studies are carried out to study the small sample behavior of the proposed approach. The evidence shows that the estimator can significantly improve on the performance of existing estimators as long as the time series dimension of the panel is large. We present an application to the evaluation of Time‐of‐Use pricing using a large randomized control trial.
10,Estimation of average treatment effects using panel data when treatment effect heterogeneity depends on unobserved fixed effects,Shosei Sakaguchi,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2752,"This paper proposes a new panel data approach to identify and estimate the time‐varying average treatment effect (ATE). The approach allows for treatment effect heterogeneity that depends on unobserved fixed effects. In the presence of this type of heterogeneity, existing panel data approaches identify the ATE for limited subpopulations only. In contrast, the proposed approach identifies and estimates the ATE for the entire population. The approach relies on the linear fixed effects specification of potential outcome equations and uses exogenous variables that are correlated with the fixed effects. I apply the approach to study the impact of a mother's smoking during pregnancy on her child's birth weight."
11,Mixed causal–noncausal autoregressions with exogenous regressors,"Alain Hecq, Joao Victor Issler, Sean Telg",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2751,"Mixed causal–noncausal autoregressive (MAR) models have been proposed to model time series exhibiting nonlinear dynamics. Possible exogenous regressors are typically substituted into the error term to maintain the MAR structure of the dependent variable. We introduce a representation including these covariates called MARX to study their direct impact. The asymptotic distribution of the MARX parameters is derived for a class of non‐Gaussian densities. For a Student 
 likelihood, closed‐form standard errors are provided. By simulations, we evaluate the MARX model selection procedure using information criteria. We examine the influence of the exchange rate and industrial production index on commodity prices."
12,Comovements in the real activity of developed and emerging economies: A test of global versus specific international factors,Antoine A. Djogbenou,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2749,"Although globalization has shaped the world economy in recent decades, emerging economies have experienced impressive growth compared to developed economies, suggesting specific comovements within developed and emerging business cycles. Using observed developed and emerging real economy activity variables, we investigate whether the latter assertion can be supported by observed data. Based on a two‐level factor model, we assume these activity variables can be decomposed into global components, emerging or developed common components, and idiosyncratic national shocks. We propose a statistical test for the null hypothesis of a one‐level specification, where it is irrelevant to distinguish between emerging and developed latent factors against the two‐level alternative. This paper provides a theoretical justification and Monte Carlo simulations that document the testing procedure. An application of the test to various data sets of developed and emerging countries leads to strong statistical evidence of specific comovements within these two groups."

14,The effect of oil supply shocks on US economic activity: What have we learned?,"Ana María Herrera, Sandeep Kumar Rangaraju",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2735,"Estimated responses of real oil prices and US gross domestic product (GDP) to oil supply disruptions vary widely. We show that most variation is attributable to differences in identification assumptions and in the model specification. Models that allow for a large short‐run price elasticity of oil supply imply a larger response of oil prices and a larger, longer lived contraction in US real GDP. We find that, if we condition on a range of supply elasticity values supported by microeconomic estimates, the differences in the oil price responses diminishes. We also examine the role of lag length, of using pre‐1973 data, alternative measures of real economic activity and using the median response function instead of the modal structural model."
15,The shale revolution and shifting crude dynamics,"Malick Sy, Liuren Wu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2745,"Oil price fluctuates in response to both demand and supply shocks. This paper proposes a new methodology that allows for timely identification of the shifting contribution from the two types of shock through a joint analysis of crude futures options and stock index options. Historical analysis shows that crude oil price movements are dominated by supply shocks from 2004 to 2008, but demand shocks have become much more dominant since then. The large demand shock following the 2008 financial crisis contributes to the start of this dynamics shift, whereas the subsequent shale revolution has fundamentally altered the crude supply behavior."
16,Regional output growth in the United Kingdom: More timely and higher frequency estimates from 1970,"Gary Koop, Stuart McIntyre, James Mitchell, Aubrey Poon",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2748,"Output growth estimates for regions of the UK are currently published at an annual frequency only, released with a long delay, and offer limited historical coverage. To improve the regional database this paper develops a mixed‐frequency multivariate model and uses it to produce consistent estimates of quarterly regional output growth dating back to 1970. We describe how these estimates are updated and evaluated on an ongoing, quarterly basis to publish online (at www.escoe.ac.uk/regionalnowcasting) more timely regional growth estimates. We illustrate how the new quarterly data can contribute to our historical understanding of business cycle dynamics and connectedness between regions."
17,Interval censored regression with fixed effects,"Jason Abrevaya, Chris Muris",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2737,"This paper considers identification and estimation of a fixed‐effects model with an interval‐censored dependent variable. In each time period, the researcher observes the interval (with known endpoints) in which the dependent variable lies but not the value of the dependent variable itself. Two versions of the model are considered: a parametric model with logistic errors and a semiparametric model with errors having an unspecified distribution. In both cases, the error disturbances can be heteroskedastic over cross‐sectional units as long as they are stationary within a cross‐sectional unit; the semiparametric model also allows for serial correlation of the error disturbances. A conditional‐logit‐type composite likelihood estimator is proposed for the logistic fixed‐effects model, and a composite maximum‐score‐type estimator is proposed for the semiparametric model. In general, the scale of the coefficient parameters is identified by these estimators, meaning that the causal effects of interest are estimated directly in cases where the latent dependent variable is of primary interest (e.g., pure data‐coding situations). Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to birthweight outcomes illustrate the performance of the parametric estimator."
18,Estimation of a dynamic stochastic frontier model using likelihood‐based approaches,"Hung‐pin Lai, Subal C. Kumbhakar",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2746,"This paper considers a panel stochastic production frontier model that allows the dynamic adjustment of technical inefficiency. In particular, we assume that inefficiency follows an AR(1) process. That is, the current year's inefficiency for a firm depends on its past inefficiency plus a transient inefficiency incurred in the current year. Interfirm variations in the transient inefficiency are explained by some firm‐specific covariates. We consider four likelihood‐based approaches to estimate the model: the full maximum likelihood, pairwise composite likelihood, marginal composite likelihood, and quasi‐maximum likelihood approaches. Moreover, we provide Monte Carlo simulation results to examine and compare the finite‐sample performances of the four above‐mentioned likelihood‐based estimators of the parameters. Finally, we provide an empirical application of a panel of 73 Finnish electricity distribution companies observed during 2008–2014 to illustrate the working of our proposed models."
19,Multivariate dynamic intensity peaks‐over‐threshold models,"Nikolaus Hautsch, Rodrigo Herrera",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2741,"We propose a multivariate dynamic intensity peaks‐over‐threshold model to capture extremes in multivariate return processes. The random occurrence of extremes is modeled by a multivariate dynamic intensity model, while temporal clustering of their size is captured by an autoregressive multiplicative error model. Applying the model to daily returns of three major stock indexes yields strong empirical support for a temporal clustering of both the occurrence and the size of extremes. Backtesting value‐at‐risk and expected shortfall forecasts shows that the consideration of clustering effects and of feedback between the magnitudes and the intensity of extremes results in better forecasts of risk."

21,,"James Morley, Benjamin Wong",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.2733,"We consider how to estimate the trend and cycle of a time series, such as real gross domestic product, given a large information set. Our approach makes use of the Beveridge–Nelson decomposition based on a vector autoregression, but with two practical considerations. First, we show how to determine which conditioning variables span the relevant information by directly accounting for the Beveridge–Nelson trend and cycle in terms of contributions from different forecast errors. Second, we employ Bayesian shrinkage to avoid overfitting in finite samples when estimating models that are large enough to include many possible sources of information. An empirical application with up to 138 variables covering various aspects of the US economy reveals that the unemployment rate, inflation, and, to a lesser extent, housing starts, aggregate consumption, stock prices, real money balances, and the federal funds rate contain relevant information beyond that in output growth for estimating the output gap, with estimates largely robust to substituting some of these variables or incorporating additional variables."

The asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimates are presented under verifiable conditions together with simulations showing effective estimation with practical sample sizes. It is shown that tail asymmetry is prevalent in global equity index returns and can be mistaken for skewness through the center of the distribution. The importance of tail asymmetry for asset allocation and risk premia is demonstrated in‐sample. Application to portfolio construction out‐of‐sample is then considered, with a representative investor willing to pay economically and statistically significant management fees to use the new model instead of traditional skewed models to determine their asset allocation."

We show that the same interpretation can also be motivated with a model that captures key features of the US Input–Output Tables and cannot be aggregated into a standard one‐sector model. Our alternative model yields a closer match to the empirical evidence of positive comovement for consumption and investment subject shocks that permanently move the price of investment.

We then provide a forecast evaluation for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, consumer price index (CPI) inflation and the policy rate since 1982: We compare the staff's forecasts with those from commonly used time series models estimated with the real‐time data, and with forecasts from other professional forecasters, and provide standard bias tests. Finally, we study changes in predictability of the Canadian economy following the announcement of the inflation‐targeting regime in 1991.

I explore various refinements and extensions of this model, including the effects of (1) correcting an error in the measure of global real economic activity, (2) explicitly incorporating narrative sign restrictions into the estimation, (3) relaxing the upper bound on the impact price elasticity of oil supply, (4) evaluating the implied posterior distribution of the structural models, and (5) extending the sample. I demonstrate that the substantive conclusions of Kilian and Murphy (2014) are largely unaffected by these changes."
