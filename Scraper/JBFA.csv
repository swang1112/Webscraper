1,Have SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 improved the financial reporting for securitizations?,"Minkwan Ahn, Samuel B. Bonsall IV, Zahn Bozanic, Yiwei Dou, Gordon Richardson, Dushyantkumar Vyas",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12449,"Critics have alleged that securitization accounting prior to 2010 was among the causes of the recent financial crisis. In response to this criticism, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) implemented two new accounting standards, SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, to improve the financial reporting for securitizations. Bank regulators have stated their belief that SFAS 166/167 will result in a consolidated balance sheet (and risk‐based capital ratios based thereupon) that better reflects a bank's exposure to risk related to securitized assets. We document that, by ceding retained power or influence through the servicing/special servicing functions to third parties, SFAS 166/167 resulted in real effects to the extent that banks (particularly those that were weakly capitalized) achieved their accounting objectives in the post‐SFAS 166/167 period through legitimate transaction structuring in line with the intent of the new rules. Further, we use capital market participants’ assessments of risk retention by sponsoring banks as a benchmark, and provide evidence consistent with bank regulators’ beliefs. In particular, following SFAS 166/167, equity investors of sponsoring banks do not consider (consider) as risk relevant securitized assets that receive off‐balance sheet (on‐balance sheet) treatment. Securitized assets that are consolidated under SFAS 166/167 exhibit the same risk relevance as assets that are not securitized, despite contractual provisions that would seem to imply substantial risk transfer."
2,"Taxable income, future profitability, and stock returns","Bradley Blaylock, Bradley P. Lawson, Michael A. Mayberry",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12448,"Prior research suggests that investors behave ‘as if’ taxable income contains information about future performance by providing evidence of a positive association between taxable income and stock returns. We draw on the fundamental analysis literature and provide direct evidence on this assertion by examining whether taxable income predicts future pretax performance. We find that taxable income positively predicts future pretax cash flows, pretax book income, and ‘Street’ pretax earnings, suggesting that taxable income provides incremental information to book income regarding performance. Moreover, we find a positive association between taxable income and analysts’ pretax forecasts, consistent with analysts utilizing the information in taxable income when forming earnings expectations. We do not find an association between taxable income and future analyst forecast errors, implying analysts do not overreact or underreact to taxable income's performance signal. Overall, we find that taxable income provides a signal of fundamental value and corroborate the implications of prior research."
3,A re‐examination of accruals quality following restatements,"Marie Herly, Jan Bartholdy, Frank Thinggaard",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12445,"Empirical research from the first years following the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act (SOX) in the US suggests that firms improve accruals quality following restatements, but the materiality of restatements has declined since then. This decline may affect firms' responses to restatements, and hence we re‐examine whether restatements are associated with subsequent improvements in accruals quality in a more recent sample. We compare the changes in accruals quality of firms restating between 2000 and 2014 with that of a control group. We do not find that firms improve accruals quality more than the control group following a restatement, even when we isolate the types of restatements considered to be most material. However, we do find that restatements followed by the most negative stock market reactions are associated with a relative increase in accruals quality, indicating that only restatements deemed very severe by investors lead to subsequent improvements in accruals quality. Our results suggest that firms' responses to restatements have changed concurrently with the trend of fewer and less material restatements in recent years."
4,Does religiosity enhance the quality of management earnings forecasts?,"Lamia Chourou, Luo He, Ligang Zhong",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12446,"This study investigates whether firms located in areas with higher levels of religiosity disclose higher‐quality management earnings forecasts than do other firms. Using a US sample of 4,655 firm‐year observations over the period 2001 to 2014, we find that firms headquartered in counties with higher proportions of religious adherents issue earnings forecasts that are less optimistically biased and that the effect of religiosity is concentrated in firms with weak monitoring mechanisms. We also find that religiosity mitigates pessimistic bias in management earnings forecasts, but only for those issued by firms operating in low litigation industries. This result suggests that when the litigation risk is high, both ethicality and risk aversion are at work and their competing effects likely offset each other. Additionally, we document that forecasts issued by firms in more religious areas trigger stronger stock price reactions than those issued by other firms and that the effect is limited to forecasts containing optimistic bias. Overall, our results show that religiosity enhances the quality of management earnings forecasts, but the effect varies based on different conditions."
5,Underlying risk preferences and analyst risk‐taking behavior,"Sean Cleary, Jonathan Jona, Gladys Lee, Joshua Shemesh",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12441,"We investigate the relationship between underlying risk preferences on analysts’ work‐related decisions. Specifically, we examine whether facial width‐to‐height ratio (fWHR), an innate personal characteristic that has been linked to financial risk tolerance, is associated with analysts’ stock coverage decisions and the boldness of their earnings forecasts and stock recommendations. We find that high‐fWHR analysts cover firms with lower earnings predictability, and issue bolder forecasts and recommendations. Our findings shed new light on the black box of analyst decision making, assisting investment practitioners in evaluating the information content produced by different types of analysts and understanding the observed dispersion in analyst forecasts."
6,"Independent director reputation incentives, accruals quality and audit fees","David B. Bryan, Terry W. Mason",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12435,"While prior research provides abundant evidence that independent directors are associated with favorable outcomes, researchers have only recently started to investigate the impact of independent director reputation incentives. This study examines whether the reputation incentives of independent directors are associated with accruals quality and audit fees. The results reveal a negative relationship between the proportion of independent directors with relatively low reputation incentives and accruals quality. Further, the proportion of independent directors with relatively low reputation incentives is positively associated with audit fees, suggesting that auditors view lower reputation incentives as increasing risk. We also find that Big 4/5 auditor office size moderates the relationship between independent director reputation incentives and audit fees. Specifically, our results indicate that audit fees increase less in response to lower reputation incentives as office size increases, suggesting that larger offices respond to the risks associated with lower reputation incentives more efficiently than smaller offices."
7,Does executive compensation reflect corporate productivity?,Yoon K. Choi,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12437,"Recent literature has given attention to the effect of CEO‐specific productivity on the structure of CEO compensation. Our paper instead focuses on the effect of a different productivity factor—which we call “corporate productivity”—on CEO compensation. In particular, we show that corporate productivity affects the trade‐off between incentive and risk in a non‐monotonic fashion, which the literature has not yet recognized. Using various empirical proxies for corporate productivity, we show that our results are consistent with the non‐monotonic relation and thus contribute to the debates in the incentive‐risk trade‐off literature. Second, our findings also contribute to the internal capital market literature by exploring the relation between the structure of CEO compensation and excess value."
8,"Security regulations, access to capital markets, and firm performance: Evidence from China","Kun Wang, Zhe Wei, Xing Xiao, Kunpeng Sun",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12432,"This study explores the cost of security regulations in China, where firms are required to meet a certain profitability benchmark before applying for permission to raise more equity via secondary equity offerings (SEOs). Using a difference‐in‐differences setting, we show that firms affected by the regulation (i.e., firms with high external financing demands (EFD) but profitability lower than the regulatory requirement) significantly underperform their counterparts, while unaffected firms do not. The affected firms’ performance decline increases (decreases) when the requirement of profitability is more (less) restricted. Consistently, the three‐day cumulative abnormal return (CAR) of firms with high EFD is significantly negative (positive) when the regulation is tightened (loosened). Our study provides evidence on how the cost of regulation affects companies that have growth opportunities."
9,Government contracts and US bond yield spreads: A study on costs and benefits of materialized political connections,"Thanh Ngo, Jurica Susnjara",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12440,"In a 1991–2013 sample of bonds issued by US public firms, we find that the cost of debt (yield spread relative to comparable Treasuries) of suppliers to government agencies is contingent on the strategic importance of the supplier's industry. The yield spreads for strategically unimportant government suppliers are higher than for firms that are not government suppliers. If government contracts serve as tangible evidence of political connections, these higher yield spreads indicate that weaker corporate governance as a cost of political connections outweighs the benefits of said connections. For the subsample of government suppliers from strategically important industries, where the benefits of implicit bailout guarantees and revenue stability outweigh the corporate governance problems, the cost of debt is lower than for firms that are not government suppliers. The higher (lower) cost of debt for strategically unimportant (strategically important) suppliers is confined to contracting with the federal government. Our findings are robust to alternative variable and sample specifications, and to endogeneity concerns."

11,"It's OK to pay well, if you write well: The effects of remuneration disclosure readability","Danial Hemmings, Lynn Hodgkinson, Gwion Williams",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12431,"We examine whether, and how, shareholders’ votes in the Say‐on‐Pay (SOP) are affected by the readability of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A). Despite the SEC's Plain English requirement, qualitative disclosures on executive remuneration are generally long and complex. Extant evidence on whether low readability results in higher or lower shareholder dissent in the SOP, however, is ambiguous. We resolve this debate by demonstrating that the effects of readability on SOP voting are heterogeneous; while obfuscation may reduce dissent when CEO compensation is close to “normal” levels, diminished readability results in increased scepticism when pay levels are clearly excessive. The moderating role of readability is most pronounced for firms with less sophisticated shareholders, consistent with readability acting as a heuristic cue. Our results are robust to propensity score matching, and are less pronounced (1) when shareholders have less time to review the CD&A, and (2) when shareholders are distracted by competing AGMs, suggesting they are driven by readability, directly. Overall, our results highlight that greater use of Plain English in remuneration disclosures can have a substantial persuasive impact on shareholders."
12,Determinants of initial goodwill overstatement in affiliated and non‐affiliated mergers,"Sunghee Ahn, Youngsoon S. Cheon, Moonchul Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12442,"This study examines the determinants of goodwill overstatement at the time of mergers in a Korean setting. In the Korean M&A market, there are two types of mergers: mergers between independent companies (non‐affiliated mergers) and mergers between companies under common control (affiliated mergers). This study extends the literature by examining the factors likely to cause goodwill overstatement in both types of mergers. The results reveal that in affiliated mergers, goodwill at the time of a merger tends to be overstated when controlling owners have higher equity ownership in the target than in the acquirer. By contrast, information uncertainty in the target value causes initial goodwill overstatement in non‐affiliated mergers. We also find that monitoring of independent institutional investors with concentrated holdings against overpaying for the target is more pronounced when controlling owners in affiliated mergers have incentives to overpay for the target. In affiliated mergers, acquirers tend to write off goodwill more frequently when controlling owners have higher equity ownership in the target than in the acquirer. In non‐affiliated mergers, information uncertainty in the target value is significantly associated with subsequent goodwill write‐offs. These results suggest that the type of merger has important consequences for initial goodwill recognition and subsequent impairment."
13,The effect of option transaction costs on informed trading in the options market around earnings announcements,"Suresh Govindaraj, Yubin Li, Chen Zhao",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12443,We investigate the effect of option market transaction costs (a form of market imperfection) on the ability of option implied volatility‐based measures to predict future stock returns and volatility around quarterly earnings announcements. We find that the predictability is significantly stronger for firms with lower option relative bid‐ask spreads. The effect is more pronounced around positive rather than negative earnings news. We find no significant effect of option transaction costs around randomly chosen dates when there is no clustering of major information events. Trading strategies based on option market predictors and transaction costs earn monthly abnormal returns of 1.39% to 1.91%.
14,Profit shifting and tax‐rate uncertainty,"Manthos D. Delis, Iftekhar Hasan, Panagiotis I. Karavitis",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12429,"Using firm‐level data for 1,084 parent firms in 24 countries and for 9,497 subsidiaries in 54 countries, we show that tax‐motivated profit shifting is larger among subsidiaries in countries that have stable corporate tax rates over time. Our findings further suggest that firms move away from transfer pricing and toward intragroup debt shifting that has lower adjustment costs. Our results are robust to several identification methods and respecifications, and they highlight the important role of tax‐rate uncertainty in the profit‐shifting decision while pointing to an adjustment away from more costly transfer pricing and toward debt shifting."
15,How does the executive pay gap influence audit fees? The roles of R&D investment and institutional ownership,"Wenxia Ge, Jeong‐Bon Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12426,"Using a sample of US firms from 2003–2014, this study examines how the executive pay gap affects audit fees for firms with different levels of R&D investment and institutional ownership. Consistent with managerial power theory, we find that the executive pay gap is positively associated with audit fees, and that the positive association is attenuated by intense R&D investment and higher institutional ownership. We also find that the executive pay gap more strongly affects audit fees after the passage of the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act and the PCAOB's 2012 call to identify the audit risk related to executive incentive compensation. Additional analyses show that the moderating effects of R&D investment and institutional ownership on the pay gap–audit fees association are not conditional on auditor tenure, but the moderating effect of institutional ownership is stronger for firms hiring specialist auditors. Collectively, our findings suggest that auditors consider the business context, such as innovation initiative and external monitoring, when assessing audit risk related to the executive pay gap."
16,Do shareholder protection and creditor rights have distinct effects on the association between debt maturity and ownership structure?,"Henrique Castro Martins, Eduardo Schiehll, Paulo Renato Soares Terra",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12430,"This study examines the effects of the firm's ownership concentration and its institutional environment on corporate debt maturity choices. As ownership concentration and debt maturity are alternative governance mechanisms, we theorize and investigate whether their association is influenced by country‐level governance factors that enhance outside monitoring by minority shareholders and debtholders. Our investigation is based on a dataset of 50,599 firm‐year observations from 38 countries. We use a propensity‐score matching approach and find that the effect of ownership concentration on debt maturity is conditional to country‐level governance attributes. Ownership concentration has a negative effect on debt maturity in countries where both shareholder protection and creditor rights are weak. Ownership concentration, however, tends to lengthen debt maturity as protection increases, and this positive effect on the length of debt maturity is stronger in countries enhancing protection towards debtholders (instead of shareholders). We also explore other characteristics of ownership structure, such as the identity and presence of controlling shareholders. These results corroborate the view that entrenched shareholders may use debt maturity opportunistically. Our study provides new insights into the interplay between firm‐ and country‐level governance mechanisms and a deeper understanding of cross‐country differences in the association between ownership structure and debt financing."
17,Shareholder coordination and corporate innovation,"Ani Manakyan Mathers, Bin Wang, Xiaohong (Sara) Wang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12433,"We show that greater shareholder coordination, as proxied by the geographic proximity between institutional investors, is positively related to corporate innovation outcomes. This relationship is driven by coordination among dedicated and independent institutions who have strong monitoring incentives and is more pronounced among firms with lower blockholder ownership and greater information asymmetry where there is greater benefit to monitoring. We propose that shareholder coordination promotes corporate innovation through a reduction in managerial agency problems. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that greater shareholder coordination enables diffuse shareholders to monitor managers more effectively and enhances corporate innovation."
18,Disappearing investment‐cash flow sensitivities: Earnings have not become a worse proxy for cash flow,"Niclas Andrén, Håkan Jankensgård",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12427,"According to a recent conjecture in the literature, earnings have become a poorer proxy for cash flow from operations over time. We find that since 1988, when cash flow statements started to be consistently reported in Compustat, the cash effectiveness of earnings has actually increased for a large sample of US manufacturing firms. This occurs despite the introduction of fair value accounting and increasing accounting accruals during the last three decades. Also contrary to the conjecture, using more comprehensive measures of cash flow does not restore the investment‐cash flow sensitivity, which continues to be around 0.05 in more recent periods."
19,Foreign currency borrowing surrounding the global financial crisis: Evidence from Korea,"Sung C. Bae, Hyeon Sook Kim, Taek Ho Kwon",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12425,"We present a complete profile of firms’ foreign currency borrowing surrounding the 2007 global financial crisis. Employing extensive data from Korean firms during 2002–2012, we find that foreign currency borrowing is significantly related to firm attributes of export revenues, firm size, tangible assets and asset growth, as well as to macro‐level factors. These results offer two important implications. First, macroeconomic factors alone cannot fully explain firms’ foreign currency borrowing. Second and more importantly, these firm attributes are indicative of a lower default probability and larger collateral value, which would not only facilitate borrowers’ access to foreign currency debt markets but also offer lenders a better protective cushion from possible loan defaults in the face of exchange rate changes and information asymmetry on borrowers’ credits. Period wise, asset‐related firm attributes have more pronounced effects in the post‐ than pre‐crisis period. We further show that banking regulations following the crisis effectively limit the access to foreign currency borrowing by Korean firms, most significantly by those belonging to large business groups."

21,Fair value accounting: Current practice and perspectives for future research,"Ryan McDonough, Argyro Panaretou, Catherine Shakespeare",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12447,"A fundamental issue debated in the accounting literature centres on the appropriate basis for measuring firms’ assets and liabilities. During the last several decades, scholars have generated a growing body of important insights about the use of the fair value measurement attribute in financial reports around the globe. In this paper, we provide an overview of the institutional background of fair value accounting and the associated accounting standards that prescribe the use of fair value measurements under International Financial Reporting Standards and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US. We discuss and document the extent to which firms across different industries and accounting regimes recognize and disclose in their financial reports assets and liabilities measured at fair value and we reflect on aspects of the fair value accounting literature. In doing this, we identify several areas in which additional research can further our understanding of fair value measurements and disclosures."
22,Accounting conservatism and the profitability of corporate insiders,"Akram Khalilov, Beatriz Garcia Osma",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12438,"We predict that accounting conservatism influences insiders' opportunities to speculate on good and bad news, and thus, insider trading profitability. We find that greater conditional (unconditional) conservatism is associated with lower (higher) insiders' profitability from sales. We find limited evidence that conservatism influences profitability from purchases. These findings are consistent with our hypotheses on the different informational roles of conditional and unconditional conservatism, and on the asymmetric influence of conservatism over the opportunities to speculate on good versus bad news. Our research design takes into consideration the endogenous nature of insiders' trading and conservatism. The results are robust to different measures of conservatism and a number of additional analyses."
23,Selective disclosure and the role of Form 8‐K in the post‐Reg FD era,"Cristi Gleason, Zhejia Ling, Rong Zhao",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12416,"We investigate the impact of Form 8‐K filings on cross‐firm differences in analysts’ private or idiosyncratic information in the post‐Reg FD era. Using firms’ connections to the investment community to identify the likelihood of selective disclosure, we document differences in analysts’ idiosyncratic information arising from selective disclosure before 8‐K filings. While filings of 8‐Ks pursuant to Reg FD attenuate the link between connections and analysts’ idiosyncratic information, they do so only after selective disclosures have already resulted in some analysts having better private information. In addition, the connections continue to facilitate private information search after the filings of non‐Reg FD‐specific 8‐Ks."
24,The effect of trade secrets protection on disclosure of forward‐looking financial information,"Yan Li, Yutao Li",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12418,"Using the recognition of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) by US state courts as an exogenous shock to the risk of losing trade secrets, this study examines the effects of trade secrets on disclosure of forward‐looking financial information. We find that management earnings forecast frequency and forecast horizon increases after the US state where a firm is headquartered starts to recognize IDD. We also find that the effect of IDD recognition on management forecasts is more pronounced for firms that have larger market shares, higher product market competition, more intensive R&D, shorter distance to their industry rivals, and more employees who possess knowledge of the firms’ trade secrets."
25,Do anti‐bribery laws reduce the cost of equity? Evidence from the UK Bribery Act 2010,"Suhee Kim, William Rees, Vathunyoo Sila",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12434,We examine the impact of the UK Bribery Act 2010 on the implied cost of equity. We find a significant reduction in the cost of equity amongst UK firms with high bribery exposure after the passage of the Bribery Act. We further show that the Bribery Act improves internal control systems and increases stock liquidity of firms with high bribery exposure. Our results suggest that more stringent anti‐bribery regulations are not always bad for the firm.
26,The effect of audit market structure on audit quality and audit pricing in the private‐client market,"Jeroen van Raak, Erik Peek, Roger Meuwissen, Caren Schelleman",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12414,"This study examines whether audit market structure affects audit quality and audit pricing. We analyze two conceptually distinct dimensions of market structure: audit market concentration and client mobility. Focusing on the private‐client segment of the Belgian audit market, we compare the pricing and quality effects of market structure between the segment of small and medium‐sized (SME) clients and the segment of large clients to test how audit complexity moderates such effects. We find that market concentration impairs price and quality competition in the SME‐client segment. Market concentration is unrelated to audit quality in the large‐client segment, where we argue that concentration is endogenous to audit complexity. Furthermore, we find that client mobility stimulates price competition in both segments but improves audit quality only in the large‐client segment. We interpret our findings as evidence that (a) audit market concentration impairs competition especially when audits have low complexity and that (b) the large‐client market segment, characterized by higher audit complexity and higher market concentration, can also be price and quality competitive if clients are sufficiently mobile, and change auditors relatively frequently."
27,Internal information quality and patent‐related innovation,"Kelly Huang, Brent Lao, Gregory McPhee",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12439,"This study investigates how the quality of information available within a firm affects patent‐related innovative activities. Relying on recent theoretical and empirical research, we use externally observable information attributes to proxy for the quality of internal information. Our empirical results indicate that firms with higher internal information quality generate more patents and patent citations. Cross‐sectional analyses show that this positive effect is greater when firms are susceptible to greater internal information frictions due to firm decentralization, short management team tenure, and long product development cycles. We also document that firms experience an increase in patents and patent citations following an improvement of internal information quality proxied by internal control weakness remediation. Overall, our results suggest that the positive relation between internal information quality and task performance extends to patent‐related innovation, a non‐routine type of task that may rely on information originating from sources other than firms’ formal internal information systems."
28,Measuring executive personality using machine‐learning algorithms: A new approach and audit fee‐based validation tests,"Karel Hrazdil, Jiri Novak, Rafael Rogo, Christine Wiedman, Ray Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12406,"We present a novel approach for measuring executive personality traits. Relying on recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we utilize the IBM Watson Personality Insights service to measure executive personalities based on CEOs’ and CFOs’ responses to questions raised by analysts during conference calls. We obtain the Big Five personality traits – openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism – based on which we estimate risk tolerance. To validate these traits, we first demonstrate that our risk‐tolerance measure varies with existing inherent and behavioural‐based measures (gender, age, sensitivity of executive compensation to stock return volatility, and executive unexercised‐vested options) in predictable ways. Second, we show that variation in firm‐year level personality trait measures, including risk tolerance, is largely explained by manager characteristics, as opposed to firm characteristics and firm performance. Finally, we find that executive inherent risk tolerance helps explain the positive relationship between client risk and audit fees documented in the prior literature. Specifically, the effect of CEO risk‐tolerance – as an innate personality trait – on audit fees is incremental to the effect of increased risk appetite from equity risk‐taking incentives (Vega). Measuring executive personality using machine‐learning algorithms will thus allow researchers to pursue studies that were previously difficult to conduct."

30,Asymmetric impact of earnings news on investor uncertainty,"Zihang Peng, David Johnstone, Demetris Christodoulou",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12428,"We describe a model that predicts an asymmetric impact of disclosure on investor uncertainty. We show that good news tends to resolve more uncertainty than bad news, and that uncertainty can be revised upwards if the investors' prior belief is sufficiently strong and the signal is sufficiently bad. This result is in contrast to classical disclosure models, where new information always resolves uncertainty and the change in uncertainty depends only on the relative precision of the news. Using option‐implied volatility as a proxy for uncertainty, we find strong support for our predictions. We also show that our results are robust to competing explanations, notably to the leverage effect and volatility feedback, as well as to the jump risk induced in anticipation of the earnings announcements."
31,Goodwill valuations certified by independent experts: Bigger and cleaner impairments?,"Miles Gietzmann, Ye Wang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12411,"If firms disclose the use of independent valuation experts to assess the magnitude of goodwill impairments, should investors rationally condition their values on that disclosure? This research shows that firms that disclose the use of an independent valuation expert are more likely to report a higher impairment charge in an impairment year but, critically, after controlling for other determinants, the disclosing firms are less likely to have impairments in following years. Thus, when the use of an independent expert is disclosed, while it is rational for investors to downgrade firm value on the basis of the disclosed (higher) impairment charge in that year, there is simultaneously a reduced need to add an additional discount to anticipate further (strategically) delayed impairment charges. The investors need to consider the likely multi‐period time series properties of impairments, and firms may benefit from using an expert if in anticipation of future related impairments, investors significantly reduce the discount applied."
32,Gender‐diverse boards and audit fees: What difference does gender quota legislation make?,"Mehdi Nekhili, Ammar Ali Gull, Tawhid Chtioui, Ikram Radhouane",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12409,"We investigate the effect of board (audit committee) gender diversity on audit fees in the French context. We also examine whether the relationship between the proportion of female directors and audit fees is moderated by the enactment of the gender quota law in 2011. We use the system GMM estimation approach on a matched sample of French firms listed in the SBF 120 index between 2002 and 2017. Consistent with the supply‐side perspective, we contend that female independent directors and female audit committee members, by improving board monitoring effectiveness, affect the auditor's assessment of audit risk, resulting in lower audit fees. Our findings also document that, by breaking the glass ceiling, the effectiveness of the gender quota law lies not in increasing the proportion of female insider directors, but in boosting the appointment of female independent directors and female audit committee members. Using the difference‐in‐difference approach, our results reveal that female independent directors and female audit committee members are more willing to assert their monitoring skills after the quota law, leading to lower audit fees. Moving beyond tokenism, we show that, after the quota law, the negative impact on non‐audit fees is strengthened only for female independent directors."
33,"Powerful CEOs, cash bonus contracts and firm performance","Rebecca L. Bachmann, Anna Loyeung, Zoltan P. Matolcsy, Helen Spiropoulos",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12410,"We investigate whether powerful chief executive officers (CEOs) influence the conditions of their cash bonus contracts. Specifically, we examine (i) the association between CEO power and the proportion of ex‐ante cash bonus to base salary (bonus ratio), (ii) the association between CEO power and the relative use of non‐financial to financial performance targets in cash bonus contracts, and (iii) the performance consequences of incorporating non‐financial targets in cash bonus contracts. Results show that powerful CEOs are associated with greater ex‐ante bonus ratios and higher proportions of non‐financial performance targets compared to less powerful CEOs. Furthermore, the use of quantitative and corporate social responsibility (CSR)‐related non‐financial performance targets is positively associated with subsequent firm performance, and the use of undefined non‐financial performance targets is negatively associated with subsequent firm performance. These results are robust to alternative econometric specifications and variable definitions."
34,Value creation around merger waves: The role of managerial compensation,"David Hillier, Patrick McColgan, Athanasios Tsekeris",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12419,"This paper examines the relation between executive compensation and value creation in merger waves. The sensitivity of CEO wealth to firm risk increases the likelihood of out‐of‐wave merger transactions but has no influence on in‐wave merger frequency. CEOs with compensation linked to firm risk have better out‐of‐wave merger performance in comparison to in‐wave mergers. We also present evidence that cross‐sectional acquirer return dispersion is greater for in‐wave acquisitions. Our results suggest that the underperformance of acquiring firms during merger waves can be attributed in part to ineffective compensation incentives, and appropriate managerial incentives can create value, particularly in non‐wave periods."
35,"Cost of capital and valuation in the public and private sectors: Tax, risk and debt capacity","Richard A. Brealey, Ian A. Cooper, Michel A. Habib",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12413,"Cost of capital and valuation differ in the private and public sectors, because taxes are a cost to the private sector but are only a transfer to the public sector. We show how to transform the after‐tax private sector cost of capital into its pre‐tax equivalent, for comparison with the public sector cost of capital. We establish the existence of a tax induced wedge between these two costs of capital. The wedge introduces a preference on the part of the private sector for assets with rapid tax depreciation, high debt capacity and low risk. We show that, in circumstances where an asset has identical public and private sector valuation in the absence of taxes, the tax induced difference in valuation is identical to the change in government tax receipts that results from having the asset owned by the private rather than the public sector. We provide some examples of distortions that result from failure to adjust for changes in tax revenues, and show how to effect such adjustment."
36,The effects of stricter regulation on the going public decision of small and knowledge‐intensive firms,"Peter‐Jan Engelen, Michele Meoli, Andrea Signori, Silvio Vismara",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12417,"This paper studies the impact of increased securities regulation on the IPOs of small and high‐tech, knowledge‐intensive firms. We take advantage of the adoption of European SOX‐like provisions, staggered at different dates across European countries, to test its influence on the going public decision. Starting from the population of European private firms during 1995–2012, we find that the likelihood of going public has decreased among small and high‐tech, knowledge‐intensive firms. Consistently, we document a 6% and 8.5% decrease in the industry‐adjusted Tobin's Q of small and knowledge‐intensive firms that go public after the regulatory change."
37,"Payout policy, financial flexibility, and agency costs of free cash flow",Jacob Oded,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12407,"This paper explains how firms choose between dividends and open‐market repurchase programs, the prevailing method that firms use to disburse cash today. While earlier theories about payout policy are motivated by signaling, the motivation for payout in this paper is to prevent the waste of free cash by self‐interested insiders. In the model, dividends prevent free cash waste by forcing cash out, but result in underinvestment if the cash paid out is later needed for operations. Open‐market programs stimulate payout by providing personal gains to informed insiders that are associated with the firm's repurchase trade. Yet, they also avoid the underinvestment problem by leaving insiders the option to cancel the payout. Because their execution is optional, however, open‐market programs only partially prevent the waste of free cash. The model provides testable predictions that are generally consistent with the empirical evidence."
38,Blockholder leverage and payout policy: Evidence from French holding companies,"Sereeparp Anantavrasilp, Abe de Jong, Douglas V. DeJong, Ulrich Hege",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbfa.12415,"This paper focuses on dominant owners’ use of leverage to finance their blockholdings and its relationship to dividend policy. We postulate that blockholder leverage may impact payout policy, in particular when earnings are hit by a negative shock. We use panel data for France where blockholders have tax incentives to structure their leverage in pyramidal holding companies and study the effect of the financial crisis in 2008/2009. We find no difference in payout policy and financial behavior during the 1999 to 2008 period between firms with levered owners and other firms. However, in the years 2009 to 2011 following the crisis, dividend payouts increase in proportion to pyramidal debt of dominant owners. We inspect pyramidal entities individually and find that on average only 60% of dividends are passed through to the ultimate owners, with the rest predominantly used to meet debt service obligations of the pyramidal entities."
