1,Market Price of Longevity Risk for a Multi‐Cohort Mortality Model With Application to Longevity Bond Option Pricing,"Yajing Xu, Michael Sherris, Jonathan Ziveyi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12273,"We introduce a multi‐cohort continuous time affine mortality model and, along with an affine arbitrage‐free term structure model, determine implied market prices of longevity risk in the BlackRock CoRI Retirement Indexes. These indexes provide a daily level of estimated cost of lifetime retirement income for 20 cohorts in the United States. Individuals can invest in BlackRock funds that track the indexes that are quoted on the NYSE. We use our model to derive closed‐form expressions for prices of European options on longevity zero‐coupon bonds and show the impact of stochastic mortality on long‐term longevity bond option prices."
2,Correlated Trading by Life Insurers and Its Impact on Bond Prices,"Chia‐Chun Chiang, Greg Niehaus",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12276,"Our evidence indicates that U.S. life insurers’ decisions to buy and sell individual corporate bonds are correlated across companies within the life insurance industry. On average, the correlation in sell decisions is greater in smaller bonds, bonds with lower ratings, bonds that have been downgraded, and bonds that have recently experienced relatively large abnormal returns. Correlated trading was also elevated during the financial crisis. In addition, correlated buying and selling are greater when insurers designated as systemically important financial institutions are actively trading. We also find that the bonds that insurers sell in a correlated manner exhibit negative average abnormal returns during the quarter in which insurers are selling. One explanation is that insurers’ correlated selling is temporarily pushing bond prices below their fundamental value. In this case, we would expect prices to bounce back in the subsequent quarter. However, we do not find a rebound in prices and therefore our evidence supports the alternative explanation that insurers’ correlated selling is impounding information into bond prices."
3,Does Having an Affiliated Bank Improve Life Insurer Performance in a Turbulent Market?,Chia‐Chun Chiang,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12286,"I find that life insurers with bank affiliates had higher premium growth rates than did other life insurers in 2008. The higher growth is derived mainly from annuity products (deposit‐type insurance products), which are often viewed as substitutes for bank certificates of deposit (CDs). The growth effect is consistent with cross‐selling between affiliated banks and affiliated life insurers. The spread between the guaranteed rates on annuity products and CDs in financial conglomerates widened in 2008, consistent with headquarters differentiating prices to move customers within the same group. In addition, the premium growth effect in 2008 is stronger for life insurers that suffered larger balance sheet shocks, as measured by the change in the risk‐based capital (RBC) ratio. The results support that headquarters used internal markets to reallocate resources to weaker divisions."
4,The Effect of Risk Aversion and Loss Aversion on Equity‐Linked Life Insurance With Surrender Guarantees,Christian Hilpert,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12297,"We price equity‐linked life insurance with surrender guarantees and account for risk preferences in the form of risk‐averse and loss‐averse policyholders in continuous time. Risk‐averse policyholders surrender their policy for higher equity index values. Compared to optimally surrendered policies, this behavior creates substantial policy value losses. In contrast, loss‐averse policyholders surrender once the surrender benefit realizes a gain but keep under‐performing policies. This disposition effect reduces the policy value relative to both optimally surrendered policies and policies surrendered by risk‐averse policyholders. Insurers in competitive markets need to estimate their policyholders’ risk preferences accurately."
5,Sunk Costs and Screening: Two‐Part Tariffs in Life Insurance,"James M. Carson, Cameron M. Ellis, Robert E. Hoyt, Krzysztof Ostaszewski",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12283,We develop a model of insurance pricing under heterogeneous lapse rates with asymmetric information about lapse likelihood within the context of an optional two‐part tariff as a screening device for future policyholder behavior. We then test for consumer self‐selection using policy‐level data on life insurance backdating. We exploit randomness in the initial tariff size to separately identify the selection and sunk cost effects of backdating on lapse proclivity. We find that consumers who are less likely to lapse self‐select into the two‐part tariff pricing structure and we also document consumer behavior consistent with sunk cost fallacy.
6,"Selection and Redistribution in the Irish Tontines of 1773, 1775, and 1777","Yikang Li, Casey Rothschild",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12274,"We construct and analyze a new data set on the mortality experience of the nominees of the 1773, 1775, and 1777 Irish tontines. The active participation of Genevan speculators in these Irish tontines has been well documented. We use our new data to quantify both the extent to which these nominees were longer‐lived and the financial consequences of their enhanced longevity. The Genevan nominees were indeed notably longer‐lived than non‐Genevan nominees—particularly so for the 50 nominees selected by a Genevan investment syndicate. Their enhanced longevity had only trivial financial consequences for the issuer, but it led to significant redistribution from non‐Genevan to Genevan investors. We highlight the implications of this across‐group distributional risk for modern proposals to introduce tontine‐like elements into modern retirement pensions."
7,"Self‐Control, Effort Procrastination, and Competitive Equilibrium in Insurance Markets","Jing Ai, Lin Zhao, Wei Zhu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12275,"This article studies consumers’ self‐control problems in precautionary activities, their contract choices, and the welfare implications in a competitive insurance market. Present bias and consumer naivete both induce consumers to procrastinate or eventually give up precautionary efforts. In consequence, self‐control problems disrupt the monotonicity of consumers’ indifference curve on contract choices, leading to a pooling equilibrium or an absence of risk–coverage correlation, in addition to the classic result of adverse selection. Compulsory insurance raises all consumers’ welfare only in adverse selection, but not in other equilibrium patterns."
8,From Participation To Repurchase: Low Income Households And Micro‐insurance,"Renuka Sane, Susan Thomas",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12288,"The article asks what drives the time to repurchase for life and accident insurance contracts in low income households. We use data on customers of a financial services provider from three states in India and find that the probability of repurchase is highest in the first 2 months after the contract expires, and steadily declines after. This suggests a window of opportunity for financial firms and governments to target customers to ensure continuous insurance purchase. Nonmembership of microfinance groups and poor rainfall in the month of expiry affect the time to repurchase adversely. Customers who take longer to repurchase tend to increase the amount of insurance cover."
9,Death by Pokémon GO: The Economic and Human Cost of Using Apps While Driving,"Mara Faccio, John J. McConnell",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12301,"We investigate the link between smartphone usage by drivers and increases in insurance premiums by using police accident reports and exploiting the introduction of the augmented reality game Pokémon GO as a natural experiment. We document a disproportionate increase in crashes, vehicular damage, injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations where users can play the game while driving. Ignoring incremental lives lost, the lower bound estimate of the cost of users playing the game while driving translates to an increase in insurance premiums of 2.47 percent."

12,"The Reinsurance Network Among U.S. Property–Casualty Insurers: Microstructure, Insolvency Risk, and Contagion","Hua Chen, J. David Cummins, Tao Sun, Mary A. Weiss",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12269,"Reinsurance is the primary source of interconnectedness in the insurance industry. As such, reinsurance connectivity provides a transmission mechanism for financial shocks and potentially exposes insurers to contagion and systemic risk. In this article, connectivity within the U.S. property–casualty (P/C) reinsurance market is modeled as a network. We model the network of all primary insurers and reinsurers in the market. We analyze all bilateral reinsurance counterparty relationships (domestic and foreign) of U.S. P/C insurers, and we model both intra‐ and intergroup transactions. We extend the prior literature by providing a detailed examination of the reinsurance network structure, including network density, network components, centrality of individual insurers, and sub‐network analysis for top insurers. Our analysis of contagion and insolvency risk reveals that even the failure of the top 10 in‐degree or in‐strength insurers with 100 percent loss given default would not lead to widespread insolvencies in the U.S. P/C insurance industry."
13,Tail Risk Networks of Insurers Around the Globe: An Empirical Examination of Systemic Risk for G‐SIIs vs Non‐G‐SIIs,"Hua Chen, Tao Sun",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12296,"In this article, we investigate systemic risk of 157 insurers around the globe. We construct tail risk networks among these insurers using a single‐index model for quantile regressions with a variable selection technique. We develop a new network‐based systemic risk indices, taking into account expected tail losses of insurers, direct and indirect contagion effects, and the time‐varying strength of tail risk spillover. Our systemic risk indices successfully recognize global systemically important insurers (G‐SIIs). We find that on average G‐SIIs are more systemically relevant than non‐G‐SIIs, particularly during the recent U.S. financial crisis. We also find a small group of non‐G‐SIIs that are more important than G‐SIIs. Our results have significant implications for systemic risk regulation."
14,Strengthening Local Credit Markets Through Lender‐Level Index Insurance,Benjamin L. Collier,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12277,"This article considers lender‐level index insurance as a means of expanding access to credit in disaster‐prone communities. In this approach, the lender transfers the disaster risk of loans in its portfolio by contracting on an observable measure of the catastrophe. I develop and calibrate a dynamic, stochastic model using data from a community lender in Peru that is vulnerable to El Niño–related flooding. The modeled lender can insure against El Niño using an index‐based product that is available for purchase by financial intermediaries in Peru. I examine how premium rates, basis risk, and background risk may influence the lender's insurance decision and credit supply. Overall, the results suggest that lender‐level index insurance holds promise for reducing disaster‐related credit supply shocks and expanding credit access in vulnerable communities."
15,Feeling Is Believing? Evidence From Earthquake Shaking Experience and Insurance Demand,Xiao Lin,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12291,"This article investigates how a particular type of personal experience—“no‐loss” experience with minor earthquakes—affects financial decisions such as insurance purchases. We find a small temporary increase in insurance demand in areas that experience a shaking with moderate intensity, or multiple shakings with light intensity. An analysis of Google Trends data confirms an immediate increase in interest in insurance though not in seismic retrofit. These findings extend the applicability of the availability bias and hot‐hand fallacy to a broader context: financial decisions may be motivated by not only loss experience, but also recent no‐loss experience, as people may extrapolate their “feeling” to something worse. However, such experience does not motivate long‐term behavioral change."
16,Catastrophe Risk and the Implied Volatility Smile,Semir Ben Ammar,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12268,"Property–casualty insurers are exposed to rare but severe natural disasters. This article analyzes the relation between catastrophe risk and the implied volatility smile of insurance stock options. We find that the slope is significantly steeper compared to the rest of the economy and exhibits a seasonal pattern due to hurricanes. We are able to link the insurance‐specific tail risk component derived from options with the risk spread from catastrophe bonds and global economic losses caused by catastrophes. Our results provide an accurate, high‐frequency calculation for catastrophe risk linking the traditional derivatives market with insurance‐linked securities."
17,An Empirical Analysis of Market Reactions to the First Solvency and Financial Condition Reports in the European Insurance Industry,"Nadine Gatzert, Dinah Heidinger",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12287,"In 2017, insurers in the European Union disclosed their Solvency and Financial Condition Reports (SFCRs) according to the third pillar of Solvency II for the first time. The aim of this article is to empirically analyze market reactions to the first SFCRs for all publicly listed insurers in the European Union that published an English report based on an event study. We thereby investigate which key figures and textual attributes matter most to investors, using regression analyses and text mining approaches. We also discuss potential areas for improvement concerning SFCR disclosure, such as a central public disclosure platform and further standardization of disclosure requirements, which could further enhance the goals of transparency and market discipline in relation to Solvency II's Pillar 3. Our results show that SFCR key figures matter more than textual features. Specifically, we find a significantly positive market impact of the solvency ratio calculated without transitionals or adjustments and a significantly negative one for the solvency capital requirement (SCR)."
18,Risk Measures Based on Benchmark Loss Distributions,"Valeria Bignozzi, Matteo Burzoni, Cosimo Munari",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12285,"We introduce a class of quantile‐based risk measures that generalize Value at Risk (VaR) and, likewise Expected Shortfall (ES), take into account both the frequency and the severity of losses. Under VaR a single confidence level is assigned regardless of the size of potential losses. We allow for a range of confidence levels that depend on the loss magnitude. The key ingredient is a benchmark loss distribution (BLD), that is, a function that associates to each potential loss a maximal acceptable probability of occurrence. The corresponding risk measure, called Loss VaR (LVaR), determines the minimal capital injection that is required to align the loss distribution of a risky position to the target BLD. By design, one has full flexibility in the choice of the BLD profile and, therefore, in the range of relevant quantiles. Special attention is given to piecewise constant functions and to tail distributions of benchmark random losses, in which case the acceptability condition imposed by the BLD boils down to first‐order stochastic dominance. We investigate the main theoretical properties of LVaR with a focus on their comparison with VaR and ES and discuss applications to capital adequacy, portfolio risk management, and catastrophic risk."
19,Estimation of Insurance Deductible Demand Under Endogenous Premium Rates,"Joshua D. Woodard, Jing Yi",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12260,"Government‐subsidized insurance is ubiquitous, yet estimation of demand in such markets remains challenging. The premium charged for a given deductible is determined by actuarial construction; thus, observed choice‐pairs are endogenous leading to biased estimation under standard econometric approaches. A theoretical model and simulation study are developed, and a new identification strategy proposed. An empirical application using Federal Crop Insurance Program—a $100 billion/year program—data reveals that demand is quite elastic after accounting for this endogeneity. Mistreatment of such endogeneity is likely partly responsible for pervasive faulty findings of inelastic insurance demand in related applications. Policy implications are also discussed."
20,Ruin Probabilities And Capital Requirement for Open Automobile Portfolios With a Bonus‐Malus System Based on Claim Counts,"Lourdes B. Afonso, Rui M. R. Cardoso, Alfredo D. Egídio dos Reis, Gracinda R. Guerreiro",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12300,"For a large motor insurance portfolio, on an open environment, we study the impact of experience rating in finite and continuous time ruin probabilities. We consider a model for calculating ruin probabilities applicable to large portfolios with a Markovian Bonus‐Malus System (BMS), based on claim counts, for an automobile portfolio using the classical risk framework model. New challenges are brought when an open portfolio scenario is introduced. When compared with a classical BMS approach ruin probabilities may change significantly. By using a BMS of a Portuguese insurer, we illustrate and discuss the impact of the proposed formulation on the initial surplus required to target a given ruin probability. Under an open portfolio setup, we show that we may have a significant impact on capital requirements when compared with the classical BMS, by having a significant reduction on the initial surplus needed to maintain a fixed level of the ruin probability."
21,The Influence of Sellers on Contract Choice: Evidence from Flood Insurance,"Benjamin L. Collier, Marc A. Ragin",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12280,"We examine the ability of insurers to influence the coverage limit decisions of 180,000 households in the National Flood Insurance Program. In this program, private insurers sell identical flood contracts at identical rates and bear no risk of paying claims. About 12 percent of new policyholders overinsure, selecting a coverage limit that exceeds their home's estimated replacement cost. Overinsuring is expensive relative to expected loss, making it difficult to explain with standard decision‐making models. The rate of overinsuring differs substantially across insurers, ranging from zero to one‐third of new policies. Insurer effects on the likelihood of overinsuring are statistically significant after controlling for the policyholder's characteristics. Additionally, some insurers seem to encourage households to overinsure in percentage terms (e.g., buy 110 percent of replacement cost) while others encourage rounding up in dollars (e.g., to the next $ 10,000). We find that insurers’ distribution systems and commission rates influence whether their policyholders overinsure."

24,Life Insurance and Life Settlements: The Case for Health‐Contingent Cash Surrender Values,"Hanming Fang, Edward Kung",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12265,"We investigate why life insurance policies in practice either do not have a cash surrender value (CSV), or have CSVs that are small and are not adjusted for health status. We show that including health‐contingent CSVs in a life insurance contract causes a dynamic commitment problem, which makes it more costly up front for policyholders to purchase long‐term contracts (because some poor risks who would otherwise have lapsed can and will now capture the CSV instead). To the extent that life insurance policyholders’ incomes tend to increase over the course of the policy, policyholders are not willing to accept higher ex ante premium costs in return for the extra liquidity provided by the CSV. Because health‐contingent CSVs act in a similar way to a life settlement market, we also study the life insurers’ equilibrium choice of CSVs in the presence of a life settlement market. We find that optimally chosen CSVs can partially mitigate the consumer welfare loss caused by the settlement market (as in Daily, Hendel, and Lizzeri, 2008), but only if the CSVs are allowed to be contingent on health status."
25,Losses (and Gains) from Health Reform for Non‐Medicaid Uninsureds,"Mark Pauly, Adam Leive, Scott Harrington",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12255,"This article examines how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would change financial resources for and transfers to the previously uninsured if they were to purchase coverage in the ACA insurance exchanges (marketplaces) in 2014. The results suggest that the law provides gains to some, relative to their spending in the pre‐ACA period, particularly those in poor health and with very low incomes, but it also potentially imposes financial losses on many, again compared to their experience when uninsured. We estimate changes in expected payments—defined as premiums plus expected out‐of‐pocket costs—from purchasing coverage and paying cost sharing post‐ACA, relative to expected out‐of‐pocket payments when being uninsured pre‐ACA, across population subgroups characterized by income, age, and health status. We also estimate changes in expected transfers to the previously uninsured under alternative assumptions on how much health care spending increases after the ACA."
26,Health Insurers’ Claims and Premiums Under the Affordable Care Act: Evidence on the Effects of Bright Line Regulations,"Sandra Renfro Callaghan, Elizabeth Plummer, William F. Wempe",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12272,"The Affordable Care Act's medical loss ratio (MLR) provisions require that health insurers spend a minimum percentage of premiums on medical costs, thereby limiting administrative costs and profits. Analyses of annual MLR changes indicate that plans both below and above the minimum MLR manage their ratios toward the minimum standard. Our finding that plans with excess MLR manage their MLRs downward suggests that compliant plans exploit their MLR “cushions,” thus increasing profits while typically continuing to satisfy the MLR requirement. We show that 52 percent of noncompliant plans in a given year subsequently become compliant, while 14 percent of compliant plans subsequently become noncompliant."
27,Insurance Covenants in Corporate Credit Agreements,Greg Nini,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12263,"In a large sample of private credit agreements of publicly traded firms, nearly all agreements contain at least a boilerplate provision requiring the borrower to purchase insurance. In about 80 percent of the agreements, the insurance covenant is more explicit. Four additional features of the insurance covenant are quite common: requirements of coverage for specific risks, naming the lender as a loss payee, mandating that any insurance proceeds be used to repay the loan, and explicit permission for the borrower to self‐insure. Credit agreements contain more stringent insurance requirements for borrowers that pose higher credit risk. The insurance requirements are strongly positively correlated with the loan being secured by collateral, which suggests that insurance creates value by protecting lenders from unexpected changes in seniority that might happen following the destruction of collateral. Insurance covenants are an important ingredient of credit agreements designed to create a very safe claim for senior, secured lenders."
28,Insurance Fraud in a Rothschild–Stiglitz World,"M. Martin Boyer, Richard Peter",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12264,"In this article, we model a competitive insurance market where policyholders privately have information about their probability of accident ex ante and know the state of the world ex post. We combine costly state verification without commitment and arguments from insurance contracting under adverse selection to characterize the resulting allocations. Insurance fraud convexifies the insurer's zero expected profit condition, which can lead to complete unraveling with low risks dropping out of the market. The standard case, however, involves rationing of low risks, which raises their probability of fraud and their success rate when committing it. As a result, adverse selection increases fraud in the economy. We also show that cross‐subsidization from low risks to high risks mitigates the fraud externality. Our results highlight that adverse selection and insurance fraud interact in nontrivial ways and have the potential to aggravate each other."
29,Optimal Consumption and Investment Problem Incorporating Housing and Life Insurance Decisions: The Continuous Time Case,"Ko‐Lun Kung, Shang‐Yin Yang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12270,"This study considers the optimal consumption‐investment‐insurance problem incorporating housing decisions of a household when interest rates and labor income are stochastic. Under the complete market assumption, we derive the closed‐form solution of the optimal insurance demand, portfolio choice, and housing consumption. We calibrate the model using data from the financial market of Taiwan. We find that the insurer's pricing strategy has a significant impact on the household's consumption pattern. Specifically, additional loading in insurance premium allows the life‐cycle model to produce hump‐shaped consumptions of both perishable goods and housing. Loading also creates an unfair background risk to households. However, we only find a small portfolio risk reduction, because households optimally choose a large coverage to mitigate the mortality exposure. This suggests empirical background risk studies overestimate the risk reduction when insurance is available."
30,The Effect of Workplace Pensions on Household Saving: Evidence From a Natural Experiment in Taiwan,Tzu‐Ting Yang,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12254,"Population aging causes financial imbalances in pay‐as‐you‐go public pension programs. To remedy this problem, while ensuring the adequacy of retirement savings for employees, many countries complement or substitute public pensions by regulating their workplace pensions. This article exploits a pension reform in Taiwan that has mandated, since 2005, that all private‐sector employers contribute at least 6 percent of an employee's monthly wage to an individual pension account. I use workers in the unaffected sectors as a comparison group and employ a difference‐in‐differences method to estimate the impact of the reform on household saving rates. My estimates suggest that making private pensions mandatory significantly reduces the household saving rate by between 2.06 and 2.45 percentage points, thus implying that a $ 10 increase in the workplace pension could offset $ 5 to $ 6 of household savings."
31,Comparative Ambiguity Aversion in Intertemporal Decisions,"Jianli Wang, Jingyuan Li",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12253,"This article examines the effects of ambiguity aversion on intertemporal decisions when there is ambiguity about a future state. Compared to the existing literature, we allow for a three‐way separation between intertemporal substitution, risk aversion, and ambiguity aversion. Holding risk preferences, beliefs, and time preferences fixed, we explore how a change in ambiguity aversion increases the strength of the current willingness to pay. We apply our results to saving, self‐protection, and self‐insurance problems."
32,Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital for Insurance Firms With Multiperiod Asset Pricing Models,"Alexander Barinov, Jianren Xu, Steven W. Pottier",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jori.12267,"Previous research on insurer cost of equity (COE) focuses on single‐period asset pricing models. In reality, however, investment and consumption decisions are made over multiple periods, exposing firms to time‐varying risks related to economic cycles and market volatility. We extend the literature by examining two multiperiod models—the conditional capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) and the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM). Using 29 years of data, we find that macroeconomic factors significantly influence and explain insurer stock returns. Insurers have countercyclical beta, implying that their market risk increases during recessions. Further, insurers are sensitive to volatility risk (the risk of losses when volatility goes up), but not to insurance‐specific risks, financial industry risks, liquidity risk, or coskewness after controlling for other economy‐wide factors."
