1,"Overconfidence and Resistance to Abandoning Unprofitable Capital Budgeting Projects: The Effects of Autonomy, Internal Audit, and Accountability","Johnny Jermias, Billy Kin Hoi Hu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3838.12222,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of managers' autonomy in choosing a capital budgeting project has on their confidence in managing the project. Furthermore, this study examines the role that internal audit reports and accountability play in mitigating the impact of autonomy on managers' resistance to abandoning unprofitable capital budgeting projects. Building on motivated reasoning theory, we hypothesize and find that managers who are given autonomy to choose their own projects are more confident that their projects will be successful than managers who are assigned the projects by their superiors. This study also shows that internal audit reports and accountability are effective mechanisms for reducing the influence of prior decisions on managers' resistance to abandoning unprofitable projects."
2,Cybersecurity Disclosure by the Companies on the S&P/TSX 60 Index,"Sylvie Héroux, Anne Fortin",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3838.12220,"Cybersecurity has become a topic of great interest since 2010. Accounting issues surrounding cybersecurity governance, management, and disclosure have gained attention from accounting standard setters, large accounting firms, and professional associations, but only a limited number of studies have looked at cybersecurity disclosure. In this study, we examine whether the content of cybersecurity disclosures of Canadian firms comprising the S&P/TSX 60 index is aligned with best practices—that is, financial regulators' guidelines in that matter. A content analysis was performed of documents issued between January 2017 and mid‐2018, consisting of recent annual information forms (AIFs), annual and quarterly management's discussion and analysis (MD&As), proxy circulars, material change reports, and news releases. To assess the nature and extent of cybersecurity disclosure, we developed a scoring grid featuring 40 items based on financial regulators' guidelines. Results show that cybersecurity disclosure levels are low. Companies vary widely in the amount of detail they provide, and the information is often not company‐specific. The variations among industrial sectors involve the categories related to cybersecurity risk, cybersecurity risk mitigation, and other items. Most of the companies provided cybersecurity disclosures in the annual MD&A, and several reiterated some disclosure items in the AIF and proxy circular. The results of this study highlight some areas where cybersecurity disclosures have evolved and others where they could be improved. They suggest that some firms strive to avoid boilerplate language and be more company‐specific. The findings also suggest that financial regulators could issue more stringent requirements."
3,Hill Valley University,"Barbara Sainty, Ed Wall",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3838.12221,"Hill Valley University is faced with a number of issues in the current year, including a $12 million deficit. You, CPA, are asked to analyze a number of strategic and operational issues to help the Board make important decisions regarding various program growth and cost savings opportunities. You also are asked to assess the impact of various initiatives on the university's strategic plan and its students. Some issues, such as recruiting more international students and increasing class size, may affect the student learning experience. Other issues, such as the building of a new residence and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, may help the university increase its ranking. You, CPA, are also asked to incorporate your recommendations into a five‐year budget."

7,Jack's Sports Bar,Douglas Kalesnikoff,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3838.12216,"This two‐part case focuses on indicators or red flags of a possible fraud being committed by a majority shareholder against a minority shareholder. The student assumes the role of an accountant investigating the possible fraud. In Part 1 the student is provided with a whistleblower complaint and examines the draft financial statements that will be used for the purchase price of the sale of shares by the minority shareholder to the majority shareholder. In Part 2 the student is provided with further information on inventory controls and the accounting practices. Drawing on the student's knowledge of control systems and financial statement analysis, the student's task is to identify the possible fraudulent transactions and quantify their effect."
8,Activity‐based Costing in a Challenging Business Environment: An Instructional Case,Sameer Alrishani,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3838.12217,"This cross‐disciplinary case study uses the concept of the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) in the upstream petroleum industry to demonstrate the application of activity‐based costing in a challenging international business environment. The case is designed and implemented to encourage students to critically address and solve legal, operational, and accounting challenges from a global perspective. This case is intended to be an appropriate hands‐on, experiential tool for undergraduate degree‐level managerial accounting classes. The learning objectives of this case include (i) to develop an understanding of the PSAs and identify their potential related challenges; (ii) to apply activity‐based costing using a multiple‐step approach in a unique, international, realistic, and challenging environment; and (iii) to identify the gaps between the current case activity‐based costing application and IFRS."
