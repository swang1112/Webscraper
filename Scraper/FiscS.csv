3,COVID‐19 and Ethnic Inequalities in England and Wales*,"Lucinda Platt, Ross Warwick",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12228,"The economic and public health crisis created by the COVID‐19 pandemic has exposed existing inequalities between ethnic groups in England and Wales, as well as creating new ones. We draw on current mortality and case data, alongside pre‐crisis labour force data, to investigate the relative vulnerability of different ethnic groups to adverse health and economic impacts. After accounting for differences in population structure and regional concentration, we show that most minority groups suffered excess mortality compared with the white British majority group. Differences in underlying health conditions such as diabetes may play a role; so too may occupational exposure to the virus, given the very different labour market profiles of ethnic groups. Distinctive patterns of occupational concentration also highlight the vulnerability of some groups to the economic consequences of social distancing measures, with Bangladeshi and Pakistani men particularly likely to be employed in occupations directly affected by the UK's ‘lockdown’. We show that differences in household structures and inequalities in access to savings mean that a number of minority groups are also less able to weather short‐term shocks to their income. Documenting these immediate consequences of the crisis reveals the potential for inequalities to become entrenched in the longer term."
4,COVID‐19 and Inequalities,"Richard Blundell, Monica Costa Dias, Robert Joyce, Xiaowei Xu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12232,"This paper brings together evidence from various data sources and the most recent studies to describe what we know so far about the impacts of the COVID‐19 crisis on inequalities across several key domains of life, including employment and ability to earn, family life and health. We show how these new fissures interact with existing inequalities along various key dimensions, including socio‐economic status, education, age, gender, ethnicity and geography. We find that the deep underlying inequalities and policy challenges that we already had are crucial in understanding the complex impacts of the pandemic itself and our response to it, and that the crisis does in itself have the potential to exacerbate some of these pre‐existing inequalities fairly directly. Moreover, it seems likely that the current crisis will leave legacies that will impact inequalities in the long term. These possibilities are not all disequalising, but many are."
5,Modelling the Distributional Impact of the COVID‐19 Crisis,"Cathal O'Donoghue, Denisa M. Sologon, Iryna Kyzyma, John McHale",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12231,"The COVID‐19 emergency has had a dramatic impact on market incomes and income‐support policies. The lack of timely available data constrains the estimation of the scale and direction of recent changes in the income distribution, which in turn constrains policymakers seeking to monitor such developments. We overcome the lack of data by proposing a dynamic calibrated microsimulation approach to generate counterfactual income distributions as a function of more timely external data than are available in dated income surveys. We combine nowcasting methods using publicly available data and a household income generation model to perform the first calibrated simulation based upon actual data, aiming to assess the distributional implications of the COVID‐19 crisis in Ireland. Overall, we find that the crisis had an equalizing real‐time effect for both gross and disposable incomes, notwithstanding the significant hardship experienced by many households."
6,Recessions and Health: The Long‐Term Health Consequences of Responses to the Coronavirus,"James Banks, Heidi Karjalainen, Carol Propper",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12230,"The lockdown measures that were implemented in the spring of 2020 to stop the spread of COVID‐19 are having a huge impact on economies in the UK and around the world. In addition to the direct impact of COVID‐19 on health, the following recession will have an impact on people's health outcomes. This paper reviews economic literature on the longer‐run health impacts of business‐cycle fluctuations and recessions. Previous studies show that an economic downturn, which affects people through increased unemployment, lower incomes and increased uncertainty, will have significant consequences on people's health outcomes both in the short and longer term. The health effects caused by these adverse macroeconomic conditions will be complex and will differ across generations, regions and socio‐economic groups. Groups that are vulnerable to poor health are likely to be hit hardest even if the crisis hit all individuals equally, and we already see that some groups such as young workers and women are worse hit by the recession than others. Government policies during and after the pandemic will play an important role in determining the eventual health consequences."
7,The Wider Impacts of the Coronavirus Pandemic on the NHS,"Carol Propper, George Stoye, Ben Zaranko",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12227,"The coronavirus pandemic has had huge impacts on the National Health Service (NHS). Patients suffering from the illness have placed unprecedented demands on acute care, particularly on intensive care units (ICUs). This has led to an effort to dramatically increase the resources available to NHS hospitals in treating these patients, involving reorganisation of hospital facilities, redeployment of existing staff and a drive to bring in recently retired and newly graduated staff to fight the pandemic. These increases in demand and changes to supply have had large knock‐on effects on the care provided to the wider population. This paper discusses likely implications for healthcare delivery in the short and medium term of the responses to the coronavirus pandemic, focusing primarily on the implications for non‐coronavirus patients. Patterns of past care suggest those most likely to be affected by these disruptions will be older individuals and those living in more deprived areas, potentially exacerbating pre‐existing health inequalities. Effects are likely to persist into the longer run, with particular challenges around recruitment and ongoing staff shortages."
8,Could COVID‐19 Infect the Consumer Prices Index?,"Richard Blundell, Rachel Griffith, Peter Levell, Martin O'Connell",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12229,"The spread of COVID‐19 has led to sweeping changes in the way households work, spend their time and shop, resulting in different shopping patterns and rapid price changes in some goods. How will changes such as these be reflected in headline inflation measures such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI)? This paper discusses problems in interpreting the CPI as a measure of how the cost of living is changing during the lockdown."
9,The Impact of COVID‐19 on Share Prices in the UK,"Rachel Griffith, Peter Levell, Rebekah Stroud",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12226,"The spread of COVID‐19, and international measures to contain it, are having a major impact on economic activity in the UK. In this paper, we describe how this impact has varied across industries, using data on share prices of firms listed on the London Stock Exchange, and how well targeted government support for workers and companies is in light of this."
10,The Challenges for Labour Market Policy during the COVID‐19 Pandemic,"Monica Costa Dias, Robert Joyce, Fabien Postel‐Vinay, Xiaowei Xu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12233,"The COVID‐19 pandemic is having a dramatic economic impact in most countries. In the UK, it has led to sharp falls in labour demand in many sectors of the economy and to initial acute labour shortages in other sectors. Much more than in a typical downturn, the current crisis is not simply a general slowdown in economic activity but also a radical short‐term shift in the mix of economic activities – of which an unknown, but possibly significant, amount will be persistent. The initial policy response has focused on cushioning the blow to families’ finances and allowing the majority of workers and firms to resume their original activities once the crisis subsides. These are crucial priorities. But there should also be a focus on reallocating some workers, either temporarily if working in shut‐down sectors or permanently by facilitating transitions to sectors and jobs offering better prospects and facing labour shortages. The phasing‐out of the furlough subsidies, which is projected to happen in Autumn 2020, brings this into even sharper focus since the alternative for many workers will be unemployment. Active labour market policy will need to be front and centre."

12,Understanding Different Approaches to Benefit‐Based Taxation,"Robert Scherf, Matthew Weinzierl",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12204,"The normative principle of benefit‐based taxation has exerted substantial influence on many areas of public finance, but it has been largely set aside in the modern theoretical approach to optimal income taxation, where welfarist objectives dominate. A prerequisite for that gap to close is the clarification of what benefit‐based income taxation would mean, specifically in a first‐best setting. This paper seeks to provide clear, accessible descriptions and novel graphical representations of four major approaches to first‐best benefit‐based taxation, explain how these approaches relate to each other, and apply them within the classical benefit‐based framework for optimal income taxation of Smith (1776)."
13,Tax Responses at Low Taxable Incomes: Evidence from Germany,Simeon Schächtele,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12220,"The desirability of a particular tax system depends on how different taxpayers react to it. Exploiting the personal allowance threshold and detailed German tax administration data, this paper examines responses at low taxable incomes to extend previous findings. Taxpayers bunch at the allowance threshold, and more so with non‐wage income. Unlike in other studies, wage earners also bunch, at least if they file a tax return, while incomes gross of deductions do not. Deductions account for a sizeable share of the sharp bunching mass of taxpayers with non‐wage income. A machine learning analysis identifies which deduction items predict such sharp bunching. The pattern of results suggests that local intensive‐margin real responses induce moderate deadweight loss."
14,Does Tax Evasion Affect Economic Crime?,"Amedeo Argentiero, Bruno Chiarini, Elisabetta Marzano",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12214,"This paper examines the effect of tax evasion on criminal activities in Italy. Specifically, we consider three types of crime that are related to economic determinants: property crimes (including robbery, theft and car theft), fraud and usury. We estimate different econometric models using annual data from the Italian provinces (NUTS‐3 level) for the 2004–12 period. We find that tax evasion positively affects economic crimes, and our results suggest that tax evasion is an incentive to engage in criminal activities, in addition to more standard determinants that we include in the analysis, such as labour market opportunities and deterrence. Moreover, these crimes demonstrate different levels of persistence over time and reflect different adjustment costs."

17,Consumption and Wage Inequality in the US: The Dynamics of the Last Three Decades,"Neil Amin‐Smith, Orazio P. Attanasio",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12209,"In this paper, we look at the evolution of consumption and wage inequality from 1980 to 2016 in the US. We use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) to look at differences in consumption and wages across groups in the population defined by educational attainment of the household head and year‐of‐birth cohort. We show that the results obtained by Attanasio and Davis (1996) for non‐durable consumption still hold in more recent decades. In addition to non‐durable consumption and services, we look at inequality measured in terms of expenditure on and stock of vehicles. The advantages of looking at these measures are that information on cars is typically measured more accurately than other components of expenditure and consumers are more likely to react by adjusting their stock of vehicles on the basis of long‐term expectations about their economic prospects."
18,Changes in Assortative Matching and Inequality in Income: Evidence for the UK,"Pierre‐André Chiappori, Monica Costa‐Dias, Sam Crossman, Costas Meghir",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12217,"The extent to which like‐with‐like marry is important for inequality as well as for the outcomes of children who result from the union. In this paper, we present evidence on changes in assortative mating and its implications for household inequality in the UK. Our approach contrasts with others in the literature in that it is consistent with an underlying model of the marriage market. We argue that a key advantage of this approach is that it creates a direct connection between changes in assortativeness in marriage and changes in the value of marriage for the various possible matches by education group. Our empirical results do not show a clear direction of change in assortativeness in the UK between the birth cohorts of 1945–54 and 1965–74. We find that changes in assortativeness pushed income inequality up slightly, but that the strong changes in education attainment across the two cohorts contributed to scale down inequality."
19,Cognitive and Non‐Cognitive Impacts of High‐Ability Peers in Early Years,"Christopher Belfield, Imran Rasul",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12216,"The sorting of students into ability groups is one of the most common, controversial and long‐examined educational practices. Ability grouping also mechanically changes peer groups. We provide novel evidence on the cognitive and non‐cognitive impacts in early years, of being exposed to higher‐ability classroom peers through being assigned to the top within‐class ability group. We exploit panel data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which allows us to construct trajectories of the cognitive and non‐cognitive development of children from birth to entry into primary school. The data also record school grouping policies and the specific within‐class group assignment of each child, by subject. We combine these rich data with an instrumental variable design using child‐level variation in group assignment due to month of birth, in order to measure the local average treatment effect (LATE) of being assigned to the highest‐ability peer group. We find that if a marginal student is assigned higher‐ability peers, this significantly reduces their cognitive achievement in mathematics, and has no impact on literacy. There are countervailing impacts on non‐cognitive outcomes for the marginal student assigned higher‐ability peers: although they are more motivated to study and parents respond with an improved home learning environment, these children have more study‐related difficulties and their relations with their peers significantly worsen. These findings have important policy implications for the use and design of within‐class ability grouping in early years."
20,The Trade‐Off between Insurance and Incentives in Differentiated Unemployment Policies,Johannes Spinnewijn,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12199,"In this paper, I revisit the central trade‐off between insurance and incentives in the design of unemployment insurance policies. The generosity of unemployment insurance benefits differs not only across countries, but also across workers within countries. After illustrating some important dimensions of heterogeneity in a cross‐country analysis, I extend the standard Baily–Chetty formula to identify the key empirical moments and elasticities required to evaluate the differentiated unemployment policy within a country. I also review some prior work and aim to provide guidance for future work trying to inform the design of unemployment policies."
21,Disability Insurance: Theoretical Trade‐Offs and Empirical Evidence,"Hamish Low, Luigi Pistaferri",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12215,"Disability insurance provides protection against health shocks that limit the ability to work. In most countries, these programmes are large and growing, both in expenditure and in number of recipients. We discuss the traditional trade‐off between insurance and incentives in providing this insurance, with a focus on the US and UK experiences. There is substantial evidence on the extent of the labour supply incentive costs of disability insurance, but there has been a lack of evidence on the insurance value until very recently. Further, evidence on errors in the disability insurance process suggests false rejections of genuine claimants is a substantial problem, and these are more serious than false acceptances of healthy applicants. We provide a life‐cycle framework for understanding the trade‐offs and to evaluate the welfare implications of policy reforms. We argue that reforms should be focused on reducing false rejections and supporting labour market attachment. The difficulty in considering reform is that the design of disability insurance has many aspects that interact and impact on outcomes."
22,What's on the Menu? Policies to Reduce Young People's Sugar Consumption,"Rachel Griffith, Martin O'Connell, Kate Smith, Rebekah Stroud",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12194,"Young people in the UK consume far above the maximum recommended levels of added sugar. It is likely that neither they nor their parents fully take account of the future health, social and economic costs of this high sugar consumption. This provides a rationale for policy intervention. The majority of young people's added sugar consumption occurs in the home, where purchases are typically made by parents. This means that understanding the purchase decisions of adults is important for policy design, even if the policies aim to reduce the consumption of young people. We discuss the merits of popular policies, including taxes, advertising restrictions and restrictions on the availability of specific foods, and we identify promising avenues for future research."
23,Retirement and Healthy Eating,"Martina Celidoni, Chiara Dal Bianco, Vincenzo Rebba, Guglielmo Weber",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12196,"This paper investigates the effect of retirement on healthy eating using data drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We estimate the causal effect of retiring from work on daily fruit or vegetable consumption by exploiting policy changes in eligibility rules for early and statutory retirement. Our results show that changes in eating behaviour upon retirement are gender‐specific: retirement induces men to reduce healthy eating; it has no effect on women. We further show that, for men, retirement increases the probability of becoming obese."
24,Health and Employment amongst Older Workers,"Jack Britton, Eric French",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-5890.12213,"Health and employment are strongly correlated. This paper reviews the existing evidence and brings in new evidence on the following issues: (a) the measurement of health; (b) the impact of health on employment rather than just the association between health and employment; (c) the mechanisms by which health impacts employment; and (d) the likely effect of recent retirement and disability policy changes in the UK. Although the magnitude of the estimated effect of health on employment varies greatly from study to study, some of this variation is driven by the health measure used. Given our preferred measure, the evidence suggests that 5–10 per cent of the employment decline between ages 50 and 70 is due to declining health in England, with the largest effects among low‐educated men. Most of the effect comes through declining preferences for work and lower productivity when in bad health, although some of the effect is from government‐provided incentives to not work when in bad health, such as from disability benefits."
