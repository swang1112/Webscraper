1,"Liquidity shocks, commodity financialization, and market comovements","Conghui Hu, Zhibing Li, Xiaoyu Liu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22127,"We explore whether and how liquidity factors influence risk transfers between commodity and stock markets using a composite liquidity index and five different types of liquidity measures. We find that liquidity shocks, including both funding liquidity and market liquidity, are positively associated with comovements between commodity and stock markets after 2000, although the relationship is insignificant before 2000. The structural change indicates that financialization creates a role for adverse liquidity shocks to increase cross‐market correlations. Further evidence shows that the effect of liquidity on cross‐market correlations is state‐dependent and intensifies when liquidity conditions deteriorate and asset returns sustain substantial declines. Our findings are not explained by business cycles."
2,Bid and ask prices of index put options: Which predicts the underlying stock returns?,"Jian Chen, Yangshu Liu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22121,"In this study, we separately estimate the implied volatility from the bid and ask prices of deep out‐of‐the‐money put options on the S&P500 index. We find that the implied volatility of ask prices has stronger predictive power for stock returns than does the implied volatility of bid prices. We identify two sources of the better performance of the ask price implied volatility: one is its stronger predictive power during economic recessions and in the presence of increasing intermediary capital risk, and the other is its richer information about the future market variance risk premium."
3,Metal prices made in China? A network analysis of industrial metal futures,"Pierre L. Siklos, Martin Stefan, Claudia Wellenreuther",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22125,"In addition to being the world's greatest consumer and producer of industrial metals, China now also features the most actively traded industrial metal futures contracts worldwide. To examine China's role in the global price formation process of industrial metal futures markets, we use a sample of 29 futures contracts traded on exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, India, and China. We estimate vector autoregressive models and conduct variance decompositions, which are then visualized in the form of networks. The results indicate that China, despite its role as key actor in both real and financial industrial metal markets, is a price taker."
4,The role of financial investors in determining the commodity futures risk premium,Mohammad Isleimeyyeh,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22122,"I develop and test a model to study the interaction between the commodity and stock markets. This study attempts to clarify the debate about the effect of financialization on commodity markets. Theoretically, the futures risk premium is determined by hedging pressure, stock market returns, and the commodity–equity correlation. Empirically, the effect of the stock market on the energy market became significantly greater for the futures risk premium in the period following the 2008 crisis. Furthermore, hedging pressure is a strong explanatory variable for the futures risk premium in various circumstances."
5,When trading options is not the only option: The effects of single‐stock futures trading on options market quality,"George J. Jiang, Yoshiki Shimizu, Cuyler Strong",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22126,"We use the 2008 short‐selling ban to examine the impact of single‐stock futures (SSFs) trading on options market quality. We show that there is a substitution effect between options trading and SSFs trading during the ban period. In addition, our results show that SSFs trading had a significant effect in narrowing the bid‐ask spreads of options contracts. Moreover, compared to stocks without SSFs, stocks with SSFs were less likely to violate put‐call parity during the ban period. Our results suggest that SSFs trading helps mitigate the negative effect of the short‐selling ban on options market quality documented in the literature."
6,"Samuelson hypothesis, arbitrage activity, and futures term premiums","Robert Brooks, Pavel Teterin",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22128,"The Samuelson hypothesis asserts that futures volatility increases as maturity decreases. On the basis of 10 US commodity futures and by capturing the dynamics of the futures volatility terms structure with three factors, we show that in most markets the slope factor is strongly negative in certain periods and at best only weakly negative in other periods. High inventory levels are found to correspond to flatter volatility term structures in seven futures. This finding is consistent with the linkage between carry arbitrage and the Samuelson hypothesis. We also find that a flatter volatility term structure corresponds to lower absolute futures term premiums."
7,A revisit to the hedge and safe haven properties of gold: New evidence from China,"Lei Ming, Xinran Zhang, Qianqiu Liu, Shenggang Yang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22124,"We examine the role of gold as a hedge and safe haven from the perspective of Chinese investors. Using the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE)‐Gold futures prices and the CSI 300 index from 2008 to 2017, we find that gold is not a hedge against the Chinese stock market on average. However, gold acts as a safe haven when market returns are below their 1%, 5%, and 10% quantiles and during the two crash periods. Our findings apply to most of the industry sectors as well. We also show that the role of gold can change drastically due to some market policy reforms."

10,The effect of oil price shocks on asset markets: Evidence from oil inventory news,"Ron Alquist, Reinhard Ellwanger, Jianjian Jin",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22096,"We quantify the reaction of U.S. equity, bond futures, and exchange rate returns to oil price shocks driven by oil inventory news. Across most sectors, equity prices decrease in response to higher oil prices before the 2007/2008 crisis but increase after it. Positive oil price shocks cause a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against a broad range of currencies but have only a modest effect on bond futures returns. The evidence suggests that changes in risk premia help to explain the time‐varying effect of oil price shocks on U.S. equity returns."
11,Trading and information in futures markets,"Guillermo Llorente, Jiang Wang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22079,"This paper studies the trading behavior of different types of traders (customer type indicators [CTI's]) in corn futures. Nonmembers (CTI4) consume most of the intraday liquidity while local traders (CTI1) as market makers are its main provider. Both groups combine most of the intraday trading volume. Interday trading comes mainly from proprietary accounts (CTI2) and other local traders' trades (CTI3), reflecting their longer‐term needs for hedging and speculation. Changes in the overnight positions of the general public (CTI4) and clearing members (CTI2) contribute mostly to daily price discovery, while the positions of CTI3 group reflect possible information advantage about future price movements."
12,Characterizing the hedging policies of commodity price‐sensitive corporations,"Raphaël H. Boroumand, Stéphane Goutte, Ehud I. Ronn",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22072,"Many corporations face price and quantity uncertainty in commodities for which existing futures and options contracts permit corporations to hedge their risks. Finance theory has demonstrated frictions in capital markets are equivalent to risk‐averse decision‐making: Taking prices and volatilities as exogenous, decision‐makers make optimal hedge decisions as a trade‐off between risk and return. In modeling risk aversion, we use mean‐variance and mean‐value at risk‐utility functions. With options quantified as delta‐equivalent futures, using data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and gold companies, we document empirically corporations' hedge ratios appear to respond to changing prices and volatilities in accordance with utility‐function prescriptions."
13,Oil jump risk,"Nima Ebrahimi, Craig Pirrong",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22129,"The risk premium associated with large upside jumps in oil market is a significant driver of the cross‐section of stock returns from 1986 to 2014. In contrast to previous research, variance risk is priced only when we do not control for jumps. Upward jumps are priced in tight supply‐demand conditions but not in more abundant supply periods. There is some evidence that downward jumps are priced in abundant supply conditions but not in tight conditions. Innovations in risk neutral jumps have predictive power for important economic indicators, including notably consumption growth. This helps explain the pricing of jump risks."

15,Trader networks and options risk management,"Naomi Boyd, Peter Locke, Li Sun",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22117,"We examine the effect of trading partner concentration and a matrix of variables which dictate the relative importance of a trader to the network on a set of large member proprietary traders’ risk. An increased closeness centrality and concentration of trading among network partners are found to reduce price, volatility and rebalancing risk. We further explore the nature of trading concentration established through traders’ recurring trading relationships to find that trading with an established and small network has a positive, yet costly, effect on inventory management. Relationships among market makers are important to managing their portfolio of risk."
16,Hedging costs and joint determinants of premiums and spreads in structured financial products,"Oliver Entrop, Georg Fischer",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22109,"Evaluating more than 317,000 discount certificates in the German secondary market, we find that premiums and spreads are endogenous and negatively related but depend on different key determinants. The fundamental determinants of the premiums are mainly profit‐related, that is, dividends of the underlying, issuers’ credit risk, lifecycle effect, and competition, whereas hedging costs are less important. However, initial hedging costs (IHC) are priced into the premium in the case of large inventory changes. The spread is mostly determined by hedging costs and risk components, such as IHCs, rebalancing costs, volatility, scalper risk, and overnight gap risk—but also by dividends."
17,Return predictability of variance differences: A fractionally cointegrated approach,"Zhenxiong Li, Marwan Izzeldin, Xingzhi Yao",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22110,"This paper examines the fractional cointegration between downside (upside) components of realized and implied variances. A positive association is found between the strength of their cofractional relation and the return predictability of their differences. That association is established via the common long‐memory component of the variances that are fractionally cointegrated, which represents the volatility‐of‐volatility factor that determines the variance premium. Our results indicate that market fears play a critical role not only in driving the long‐run equilibrium relationship between implied‐realized variances but also in understanding the return predictability. A simulation study further verifies these claims."
18,Optimal futures hedging for energy commodities: An application of the GAS model,"Yingying Xu, Donald Lien",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22118,"This paper applies generalized autoregressive score‐driven (GAS) models to futures hedging of crude oil and natural gas. For both commodities, the GAS framework captures the marginal distributions of spot and futures returns and corresponding dynamic copula correlations. We compare within‐sample and out‐of‐sample hedging effectiveness of GAS models against constant ordinary least square (OLS) strategy and time‐varying copula‐based GARCH models in terms of volatility reduction and Value at Risk reduction. We show that the constant OLS hedge ratio is not inherently inferior to the time‐varying alternatives. Nonetheless, GAS models tend to exhibit better hedging effectiveness than other strategies, particularly for natural gas."
19,Uncertainty and the volatility forecasting power of option‐implied volatility,"Byounghyun Jeon, Sung Won Seo, Jun Sik Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22116,"This study investigates the impact of uncertainty on the volatility forecasting power of option‐implied volatility. Option‐implied volatility is a powerful predictor of future volatility, particularly during periods of high uncertainty. This is consistent with option‐implied volatility being largely determined by volatility‐informed traders (rather than directional traders) when uncertainty is high. New volatility forecasting models that incorporate such interaction outperform benchmark models, both in‐ and out‐of‐sample. The new models also better predict future volatility during the 2008 global financial crisis, for which benchmark models perform poorly. The results are robust to alternative choices of benchmark models, loss functions, and estimation windows."
20,Volatility forecasts embedded in the prices of crude‐oil options,"Dudley Gilder, Leonidas Tsiaras",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22114,"This paper evaluates the ability of alternative option‐implied volatility measures to forecast crude‐oil return volatility. We find that a corridor implied volatility measure that aggregates information from a narrow range of option contracts consistently outperforms forecasts obtained by the popular Black–Scholes and model‐free volatility expectations, as well as those generated by a realized volatility model. This measure ranks favorably in regression‐based tests, delivers the lowest forecast errors under different loss functions, and generates economically significant gains in volatility timing exercises. Our results also show that the Chicago Board Options Exchange's “oil‐VIX” index performs poorly, as it routinely produces the least accurate forecasts."
21,"The theory of storage in the crude oil futures market, the role of financial conditions","Maryam Ahmadi, Niaz Bashiri Behmiri, Matteo Manera",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22113,"This study examines the impacts of inventory and financial instability on the basis of the crude oil market. The results show that, first, the basis rises with inventory, and this effect is higher during low inventory regimes. This validates the theory of storage in the crude oil market. Second, the basis rises with financial instability, and this effect is higher during turbulent regimes. These results warn the oil market participants that, to make decisions based on the basis variation, traditionally known as a signal of scarcity or abundance, the underlying cause of the variation has to be considered."
22,The impact of trading restrictions and margin requirements on stock index futures,"Jianqiang Hu, Tianxiang Wang, Wenwei Hu, Jun Tong",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22111,"Stock index futures in Chinese market have consistently diverged from their theoretical values. In this paper, we try to provide some explanations by proposing an equilibrium model. Although the model itself does not provide analytical solutions, it enables us to conduct extensive numerical studies and compare them with our empirical results on two major Chinese market indices, CSI300 and SSE50. Our results show that the divergence of stock index futures prices from their theoretical values may be due to various trading and regulatory constraints, such as position limits and margin requirements, which play significant roles in Chinese market."
23,Old crop versus new crop prices: Explaining the correlation,Francisco Arroyo Marioli,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22106,"Although competitive storage theory has proven successful in explaining many patterns for commodity prices, some features are not understood. While standard models predict low correlation between future prices with delivery dates before and after the harvest, the data suggest otherwise. To correct this, I assume that harvests appear continuously rather than at a single moment. This addition to the standard model allows me to link preharvest and postharvest markets to the same source of supply, and hence obtain the empirically observed high correlation. Empirical evidence also suggests that my assumptions are realistic. Results are robust to different parameter specifications."

25,Volatility as an asset class: Holding VIX in a portfolio,James S. Doran,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22094,"Hedging market downturns without sacrificing upside has long been sought by investors. If VIX was directly investable, adding it as a hedge to the S&P 500 would result in significantly improved performance over the equity only portfolio. However, tradable VIX products do not provide the hedge or returns investors seek over long‐term horizons. Alternatively, deconstructing VIX to find the key S&P 500 options which drive VIX movements leads to a synthetic VIX portfolio that provides a more effective hedge. Using these options captures correlations and returns similar to VIX, and combined with the S&P 500, outperforms the buy‐and‐hold index portfolio."
26,Return and volatility transmission between China's and international crude oil futures markets: A first look,"Jian Yang, Yinggang Zhou",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22103,"We examine return and volatility transmission between the newly established crude oil futures in China and international major crude oil futures markets using intraday data. For the first time, we document evidence for cointegration relationships among these oil futures markets. Both China's and Oman's oil futures markets react to deviations from their long‐run equilibrium with West Texas Intermediate and Brent oil futures. There is also new evidence for asymmetric volatilities and correlations across these oil futures markets. Furthermore, the Chinese oil futures have stronger linkages with the international major futures markets than Oman futures."
27,Bank risk‐taking and market discipline: Evidence from CoCo bonds in Korea,"Younghwan Lee, Haerang Park",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22097,"We investigate whether the risk profile of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds is well‐priced by testing the sensitivity of bond spreads to bank asset volatility. While equity holders (bankers) have an incentive to make riskier investments to trigger the write‐off, such risk‐taking behavior can be contained if CoCo bond investors punish it by demanding higher returns. We have found that investors in the Korean financial market understand the risk profile of CoCo bonds and require higher returns for the additional bank risk, which suggests the presence of market discipline with regard to CoCo bonds."
28,Does corporate hedging affect firm valuation? Evidence from the IPO market,"Zheng Qiao, Chongwu Xia, Lei Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22098,"Focusing on the IPO market, we examine the influence of corporate hedging on firm valuation. Consistent with the argument that hedging reduces information asymmetry, we find that hedging IPO firms are associated with lower price revisions and underwriting fees. More important, hedging reduces IPO underpricing, especially for informationally opaque firms. This provides strong evidence that corporate hedging increases firm valuation. We also show that corporate hedging lowers aftermarket idiosyncratic volatility, enhances aftermarket liquidity, and improves the long‐term performance of IPO firms. We use both an instrumental variable approach and a regulation change on derivatives supply to address endogeneity concerns."
29,Pricing VIX options with volatility clustering,"Bo Jing, Shenghong Li, Yong Ma",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22092,"We investigate the valuation of volatility index (VIX) options by developing a model with a self‐exciting Hawkes process that allows for clustering in the VIX. In the proposed framework, we find semianalytical expressions for the characteristic function and forward characteristic function, and then we solve the pricing problem of standard‐start and forward‐start options via the fast Fourier transform. The empirical results provide evidence to support the significance of accounting for volatility clustering when pricing VIX options."
30,"Inferring information from the S&P 500, CBOE VIX, and CBOE SKEW indices","Jiling Cao, Xinfeng Ruan, Wenjun Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22093,"This paper compares the information extracted from the S&P 500, CBOE VIX, and CBOE SKEW indices for the S&P 500 index option pricing. Based on our empirical analysis, VIX is a very informative index for option prices. Whether adding the SKEW or the VIX term structure can improve the option pricing performance depends on the model we choose. Roughly speaking, the VIX term structure is informative for some models, while the SKEW is very noisy and does not contain much important information for option prices. This paper also extends Zhang et al. (2017, J Futures Markets, 37, 211–237) into three typical affine models."
31,Repeated Richardson extrapolation and static hedging of barrier options under the CEV model,"Jia‐Hau Guo, Lung‐Fu Chang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22100,"This paper proposes an accelerated static replication approach for continuous European‐style barrier options by employing the repeated Richardson extrapolation technique with the Romberg sequence. This approach is developed under the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model of Cox (1975) and Cox and Ross (1976) using the framework offered by Derman, Ergener, and Kani (1995; DEK) and its modified method of Chung et al. (2010, 2013a, 2013b) and Tsai (2014). The numerical results indicate that our method could significantly reduce replication errors for European knock‐out call options and may be superior to the imposition of the theta‐matching condition on the DEK method."
32,Index options open interest and stock market returns,"Sung Won Seo, Suk Joon Byun, Jun Sik Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22095,This study finds that the growth of index options open interest has a significant relation with future stock market returns. We propose a theoretical model that considers hedgers and informed traders in the options market and suggests that hedgers fully utilize options according to their expectations of future stock returns. The empirical results show that the growth of out‐of‐the‐money call options open interest is significantly related with future stock market returns. These findings provide supporting evidence for our theoretical model.
33,When is informed trading more prevalent?—An examination of options trading around Indian M&A announcements,"Soniya Mohil, Reena Nayyar, Archana Patro",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22102,"This study examines the prevalence of informed trading around proximate‐date versus far‐date mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Further, different options strategies pursued by informed traders in proximate‐date M&As are identified. The results highlight that proximate‐date M&As are associated with a significantly higher level of informed trading vis‐à‐vis far‐date M&As. Results on the choice of options strategies highlight that risk‐averse, informed traders may pursue a straddle strategy to profit from their private information, while risk‐seeking, informed traders may use a vertical call spread strategy. Informed traders desirous of hedging their existing positions may employ a protective put strategy."

36,The risk of betting on risk: Conditional variance and correlation of bank credit default swaps,Xin Huang,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22068,"Credit default swaps (CDS) have been used to speculate on the default risk of the reference entity. The risk of CDS can be measured by their second moments. We apply a Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (GJR)‐t model for the conditional variance and a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)‐t model for the conditional correlation. Based on the CDS of six large US banks from 2002 to 2018, we find that CDS conditional variance is asymmetric and leptokurtic. A positive innovation actually increases CDS conditional variance more than a negative innovation does. CDS conditional correlations have stayed elevated since the financial crisis, in contrast to the decreasing stock conditional correlations."
37,Impact of international energy prices on China's industries,"Jin Boon Wong, Qin Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22090,"This study examines how returns and volatility of future contracts for Brent crude oil (Brent), West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI), Henry Hub natural gas, and Newcastle thermal coal impacts industries in China. Using the firm‐level data of 3,750 stock listings across both Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, segregated into 138 subindustries under the Global Industry Classification Standard, this study finds evidence that crude oil futures have the most significant influence. Further analysis suggests that stock returns of oil‐related companies are more closely align to Brent and WTI's futures returns following China's key oil pricing reform on March 27, 2013. Overall, Chinese industries are also more exposed to global crude oil futures volatility after this event."
38,Impact of algorithmic trading on speed of adjustment to new information: Evidence from interest rate derivatives,"Alex Frino, Michael Garcia, Zeyang Zhou",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22104,"In February 2012, the Australian Securities Exchange introduced co‐location services for futures traders, thus providing a natural experiment to test the impact of algorithmic trading (AT) on the speed of adjustment and price discovery during scheduled macroeconomic releases. Our results demonstrate that, in the presence of AT, the speed of adjustment to new information has improved for both exchange‐traded futures and over‐the‐counter‐traded swaps. In addition, we find that the price discovery contribution of the futures market improves in the post‐AT period, with this improvement significant for macroeconomic announcement days."
39,Show me the money: Option moneyness concentration and future stock returns,"Kelley Bergsma, Vivien Csapi, Dean Diavatopoulos, Andy Fodor",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22071,"Informed traders often use options that are not in‐the‐money due to higher potential gains for a smaller upfront cost. Thus, trading activity by option moneyness should be a gauge of informed option trading. We construct a dollar volume‐weighted average moneyness measure to capture option trading activity at different moneyness levels. Stock returns increase with this measure, suggesting more trading activity in options with higher leverage predicts future stock returns. Our results hold cross‐sectionally and at the portfolio level yielding a Fama–French five‐factor α of 12% per year for all stocks and 33% per year for high implied volatility stocks."
40,Informed options trading on the implied volatility surface: A cross‐sectional approach,"Baeho Kim, Da‐Hea Kim, Haehean Park",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22070,"This study investigates the cross‐sectional implication of informed options trading across different strikes and maturities. We explore the term structure perspective of the one‐way information transmission from options markets to stock markets by adopting well‐known option‐implied volatility measures to examine stock return predictability. Using equity options data for U.S. listed stocks spanning 2000–2013, we find that the shape of the long‐term implied volatility curve exhibits extra predictive power for stock returns of subsequent months even after orthogonalizing the short‐term components. Our findings indicate that the inter‐market information asymmetry rapidly disappears before the expiration of long‐term option contracts."
41,Predictive abilities of speculators in energy markets,Yulia Merkoulova,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22058,"Using nonparametric methodology, I find that speculators are successful in taking profitable positions in energy futures markets, although the magnitude of this effect is lower than that found previously for agricultural markets. A plausible explanation for this difference is that price forecasting is more difficult for energy commodities. Moreover, I find that the energy speculators’ returns are due to the existence of the risk premiums rather than to speculators’ forecasting abilities. Futures risk premium is highly time‐variant; notably, energy investors’ profits have been very limited in the GFC and post‐GFC period, which coincided with the financialization of commodity markets."
42,The determinants of price discovery on bitcoin markets,"Oliver Entrop, Bart Frijns, Marco Seruset",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22101,"This paper investigates whether market quality, uncertainty, investor sentiment and attention, and macroeconomic news affect bitcoin price discovery in spot and futures markets. Over the period December 2017–March 2019, we find significant time variation in the contribution to price discovery of the two markets. Increases in price discovery are mainly driven by relative trading costs and volume, and uncertainty to a lesser extent. Additionally, medium‐sized trades contain most information in terms of price discovery. Finally, higher news‐based bitcoin sentiment increases the informational role of the futures market, while attention and macroeconomic news have no impact on price discovery."

44,Pricing and integration of credit default swap index tranches,"Andrew Carverhill, Dan Luo",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22082,"This paper first designs an efficient procedure to value Credit Default Swap Index tranches using an intensity‐based model. The tranche spreads are effectively explained by a three‐factor version of this model, both before and during the financial crisis of 2008. We then construct tradable tranche portfolios to track the intensity factors and compare the pricing of the tranches with equities and their derivatives. Our results show that the senior tranche spreads do not offer returns in excess of the common risk compensations in the equity and derivatives markets, while the junior tranche is not spanned by these standard factors."
45,Volatility term structures in commodity markets,"Fabian Hollstein, Marcel Prokopczuk, Christoph Würsig",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22083,"In this study, we comprehensively examine the volatility term structures in commodity markets. We model state‐dependent spillovers in principal components (PCs) of the volatility term structures of different commodities, as well as that of the equity market. We detect strong economic links and a substantial interconnectedness of the volatility term structures of commodities. Accounting for intra‐commodity‐market spillovers significantly improves out‐of‐sample forecasts of the components of the volatility term structure. Spillovers following macroeconomic news announcements account for a large proportion of this forecast power. There thus seems to be substantial information transmission between different commodity markets."
46,Efficient trinomial trees for local‐volatility models in pricing double‐barrier options,"U Hou Lok, Yuh‐Dauh Lyuu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22080,"A local‐volatility (LV) model captures the volatility smile while retaining the preference freedom of the Black–Scholes model. Past attempts to construct a smile‐consistent tree for the LV surface do not guarantee validity. This paper presents an efficient and valid smile‐consistent tree for the LV model. The only assumption is that the LV surface be upper‐ and lower‐bounded. With this tree, double‐barrier options can be priced with fast convergence even in the presence of volatility smile. This is confirmed numerically. An implied tree is also presented. It recovers the LV surface reasonably well."
47,Speculative pressure,"John Hua Fan, Adrian Fernandez‐Perez, Ana‐Maria Fuertes, Joëlle Miffre",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22085,"The paper investigates the information content of speculative pressure across futures classes. Long‐short portfolios of futures contracts sorted by speculative pressure capture a significant premium in commodity, currency, and equity markets but not in fixed income markets. Exposure to commodity, currency, and equity index futures’ speculative pressure is priced in the broad cross‐section after controlling for momentum, carry, global liquidity, and volatility risks. The findings are confirmed by robustness tests using alternative speculative pressure signals, portfolio construction techniques, and subperiods interalia. We argue that there is an efficient hedgers‐speculators risk transfer in commodity, currency, and equity index futures markets."
48,Estimating the connectedness of commodity futures using a network approach,"Binqing Xiao, Honghai Yu, Libing Fang, Sifang Ding",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22086,"Using a network approach of variance decompositions, we measure the connectedness of 18 commodity futures and characterize both static and dynamic connectedness. Our results show that metal futures are net transmitters of shocks to other futures, and agricultural futures are vulnerable to shocks from the others. Furthermore, almost two‐thirds of the volatility uncertainty for commodity futures are due to the connectedness of shocks across the futures market. Dynamically, we find connectedness always increases in times of turmoil. An analysis of connectedness networks suggests that investors could be forewarned that the connectedness of various classes of futures could threaten their portfolios."
49,Futures market hedging efficiency in a new futures exchange: Effects of trade partner diversification,"Atle Oglend, Hans‐Martin Straume",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22088,"This paper uses transaction data to examine hedging efficiency in a new futures exchange; the Fish Pool salmon futures exchange in Norway. The paper utilizes data on firm‐level exporter/importer transaction prices to quantify firm‐level futures hedging efficiency. This allows us to address heterogeneity in hedging efficiency and basis risk at the firm level. The main result of this paper shows that larger firms with greater trade partner diversification have lower basis risk. Such firms align their internal transaction price closer to the common spot price in the market, which encourages greater futures market participation. Results are discussed in light of recent declines in participation in the salmon futures exchange."
50,Intraday time‐series momentum: Evidence from China,"Muzhao Jin, Fearghal Kearney, Youwei Li, Yung Chiang Yang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22084,"This study conducts an investigation of intraday time‐series momentum across four Chinese commodity futures contracts: copper, steel, soybean, and soybean meal. Our results indicate that the first half‐hour return positively predicts the last half‐hour return across all four futures. Furthermore, in metals markets, we find that first trading sessions with high volume or volatility are associated with the strongest intraday time‐series momentum dynamics. Based on this, we propose an intraday momentum informed trading strategy that earns a return in excess of standard always long and buy‐and‐hold benchmarks."
51,Yield curve risks in currency carry forwards,"Seungho Baek, Jeong Wan Lee, Kyong Joo Oh, Myoungji Lee",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22091,"We provide empirical evidence that cross‐country yield curve gaps (parallel gap, twist gap, and butterfly gap) are predictive to the expected currency carry premiums using currency forward contracts. We find that the expected currency gains are more notable as these yield curve risk factors at time t indicate short‐term bond prices of investment currencies to go up (positive parallel movement, negative twist, and positive butterfly). We also find carry gains are more sensitively affected by cross‐country monetary shocks than currency‐country inflation pressures and business cycles. Our findings support that cross‐country yield curve risk premiums still exist even after considering transaction costs."
52,The untold story of commodity futures in China,"John Hua Fan, Tingxi Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22087,"We investigate the behavior of commodity futures risk premia in China. In the presence of retail‐dominance and barriers‐to‐entry, the term structure and momentum premia remain persistent, whereas hedging pressure, skewness, volatility, and liquidity premia are distorted by time‐varying margins and strict position limits. Furthermore, open interest, currency, and inflation premia are sensitive to institutional settings. The observed premia cannot be attributed to common risks, sentiment, transactions costs, or data‐snooping, but are related to liquidity, anchoring, and regulation‐induced limits‐to‐arbitrage. We highlight the distinctive features of Chinese futures markets and assess the challenges posed to theories of commodity risk premia."

54,"Arbitrage opportunities, liquidity provision, and trader types in an index option market","Chin‐Ho Chen, Junmao Chiu, Huimin Chung",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22077,"This study examines the impact of arbitrage in put–call futures parity (PCFP) violations on option market liquidity and explores the liquidity provision process by trader type during periods of arbitrage exploitation. Using a unique data set comprising the complete history of transactions, we find that PCFP violations contain toxic arbitrage opportunities. Hence, more frequent toxic arbitrage opportunities can cause liquidity to deteriorate because arbitrageurs create adverse selection costs and order imbalances in the option market. In addition, when the law of one price breaks down, market makers dominate by providing liquidity compared with individual, domestic, and foreign institutional traders."
55,A rare move: The effects of switching from a closing call auction to a continuous trading,"Ya‐Kai Chang, Robin K. Chou, J. Jimmy Yang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22081,"This study investigates the effects of switching to a closing continuous trading (CCT) on market quality, while considering the trading behaviors of different types of traders. Investors become more patient in the period preceding the last trading phase, which reduces the bid–ask spread (BAS) in that period. We find an increase in the BAS and volatility during the last trading phase, due to diminishing investor patience. Market volatility and the closing pricing errors relate positively to the trading activities of foreign institutional investors. Overall, the introduction of the CCT worsens the market quality before the closing."
56,Pricing VIX derivatives with infinite‐activity jumps,"Jiling Cao, Xinfeng Ruan, Shu Su, Wenjun Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22074,"In this paper, we investigate a two‐factor VIX model with infinite‐activity jumps, which is a more realistic way to reduce errors in pricing VIX derivatives, compared with Mencía and Sentana (2013), J Financ Econ, 108, 367–391. Our two‐factor model features central tendency, stochastic volatility and infinite‐activity pure jump Lévy processes which include the variance gamma (VG) and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) processes as special cases. We find empirical evidence that the model with infinite‐activity jumps is superior to the models with finite‐activity jumps, particularly in pricing VIX options. As a result, infinite‐activity jumps should not be ignored in pricing VIX derivatives."
57,Does trade size restriction affect trading behavior? Evidence from Indian single stock futures market,"Anirban Banerjee, Ashok Banerjee",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22073,"Algorithmic traders use their advantage of speed to execute a large number of small‐sized trades in a very short time. In the presence of a minimum trading unit (MTU) restriction, they are forced to trade at the smallest possible sizes, often restricted by the MTU. Using a novel data set of single stock futures market obtained from the National Stock Exchange of India, we show that the MTU restriction acts as a binding constraint for traders while optimizing trade sizes. Contrary to expectation, we find weak evidence that liquidity is positively impacted by the contract size revision."
58,The impact of soft intervention on the Chinese financial futures market,"Jimmy E. Hilliard, Haoran Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22076,"During the 2015 financial crisis in China, participants faced the criticism that manipulators and shorts had destabilized the market. As a result, the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission intervened sequentially in the spot market and then in the futures market. Trading volume dropped precipitously. Using the cost‐of‐carry model, we find that these actions significantly impacted equilibrium pricing. Following intervention in the spot market, mispricing was attenuated but remained significant after further intervention in the futures market. We use the Hong Kong market and a difference‐in‐differences statistic to address the role of the China Securities Regulatory Commission soft intervention versus intervention by hard rules."
59,Systemic risk in global volatility spillover networks: Evidence from option‐implied volatility indices,"Zihui Yang, Yinggang Zhou, Xin Cheng",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22078,"With option‐implied volatility indices, we identify networks of global volatility spillovers and examine time‐varying systemic risk across global financial markets. The U.S. stock market is the center of the network and plays a dominant role in the spread of volatility spillover to other markets. The global systemic risks have intensified since the Federal Reserve exited from quantitative easing, hiked interest rate, and shrank its balance sheet. We further show that the U.S. monetary tightening is an important catalyst for the intensifying global systemic risk. Our findings highlight the pernicious effects of monetary tightening after an era of cheap money."
60,Analytical valuation of Asian options with counterparty risk under stochastic volatility models,Xingchun Wang,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22064,"In this paper, we consider Asian options with counterparty risk under stochastic volatility models. We propose a simple way to construct stochastic volatility models through the market factor channel. In the proposed framework, we obtain an explicit pricing formula of Asian options with counterparty risk and illustrate the effects of systematic risk on Asian option prices. Specially, the U‐shaped and inverted U‐shaped curves appear when we keep the total risk of the underlying asset and the issuer's assets unchanged, respectively."
61,A novel risk management framework for natural gas markets,"Panos K. Pouliasis, Ilias D. Visvikis, Nikos C. Papapostolou, Alexander A. Kryukov",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22067,"This paper examines dynamic hedges in the natural gas futures markets for different horizons and explores the gains from devising risk management strategies. Despite the substantial progress made in developing hedging models, forecast combinations have not been explored. We fill this gap by proposing a framework for combining hedge‐ratio predictions. Composite hedge ratios lead to significant reduction in portfolio risk, whether spot prices are partially predictable or not. We offer insights on hedging effectiveness across seasons, backwardation‐contango conditions and the asymmetric profiles of long‐short hedgers. We conclude that forecast combinations better reconcile realized performance with the hedging process, mitigating model instability."
62,Incorporating time‐varying jump intensities in the mean‐variance portfolio decisions,"Chunyang Zhou, Chongfeng Wu, Weidong Xu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22075,"This paper examines the role of time‐varying jump intensities in forming mean‐variance portfolios. We find that compared with the no‐jump or constant‐jump models, the model which incorporates time‐varying jump intensities better fits the dynamics of the assets returns, and yields mean‐variance portfolios with higher Sharpe ratios. Our research suggests that using a better econometric model that captures non‐normal features in the data has benefits for portfolio allocation even for a mean‐variance investor."
63,Risky short positions and investor sentiment: Evidence from the weekend effect in futures markets,"Vijay Singal, Jitendra Tayal",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22069,"This paper examines the weekend effect in futures markets and presents rational and behavioral reasons for its existence. Specifically, we document a weekend effect (Friday's return minus the following Monday's return) in futures markets. The weekend effect occurs partly because of asymmetric risk between long and short positions around weekends; the weekend effect increases when short positions are relatively more risky. In addition, we find that both lagged and contemporaneous changes in investor sentiment are related to the weekend effect. These results are consistent with the investor sentiment literature that finds that mood improves on Fridays but deteriorates on Mondays."

66,Flow toxicity of high‐frequency trading and its impact on price volatility: Evidence from the KOSPI 200 futures market,"Jangkoo Kang, Kyung Yoon Kwon, Wooyeon Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22062,"We examine the relation between high‐frequency trading, flow toxicity, and short‐term volatility during both normal and stressful periods. Using transaction data for the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) futures, we find the Volume‐Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) useful in measuring flow toxicity as it predicts short‐term volatility effectively. We further show that high‐frequency trading is negatively related to VPIN and short‐term volatility during normal times but has a positive association during stressful periods. Finally, we advocate the use of bulk‐volume classification (BVC) by presenting evidence that the initiator identified by BVC trades at more favorable prices than the true trade initiator."
67,Heterogeneity and netting efficiency under central clearing: A stochastic network analysis,"Injun Hwang, Baeho Kim",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22059,"This paper examines the effect of heterogeneity in clearing members’ exposure management practices under central clearing. Our network model specifies the dynamics of prenetted interbank exposures to shape interdependent exposure distributions beyond normality. Employing over‐the‐counter derivatives market data from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our simulation results indicate that heterogeneity in bank‐to‐bank exposure dynamics is systemically desirable, while the entire system benefits more from the central clearing in more homogeneous environments. Policymakers should incentivize individual clearing members to enhance resiliency and stability in counterparty exposure management to maximize netting efficiency under central clearing."
68,The impact of net buying pressure on VIX option prices,"Yi‐Wei Chuang, Wei‐Che Tsai, Ming‐Hung Wu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22060,"This paper analyzes the impact of intraday trading activity on option prices in the Volatility Index (VIX) options market. Our results show that there is a temporal relationship between net buying pressure (NBP) and changes in implied volatility of VIX options. Moreover, an increase in NBPs lowers the next‐day delta‐hedged option returns. Using several measures proxying for limits to arbitrage, the average levels of the implied volatility curve rise when limits to arbitrage are severe. A trading strategy in the VIX futures market constructed by using the NBP generates an average annualized return of 10.09%."
69,Are disposition effect and skew preference correlated? Evidence from account‐level ELW transactions,"Youngsoo Choi, Woojin Kim, Eunji Kwon",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22055,"This paper examines whether two well‐known cognitive biases, disposition effect and skew preference, may reflect a common feature of certain investors. On the basis of a unique proprietary dataset that provides the details of all transactions in the Korean equity‐linked warrant (ELW) market between 2009 and 2011, we find that investors who realize gains faster than losses are also more likely to trade out‐of‐the‐money ELWs. Investors who are less (more) subject to both biases exhibit the best (worst) risk‐adjusted trading performance. Our findings suggest that disposition effect and skew preference occur simultaneously, which could adversely affect trading performance."
70,Systemic risk in market microstructure of crude oil and gasoline futures prices: A Hawkes flocking model approach,"Hyun Jin Jang, Kiseop Lee, Kyungsub Lee",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22048,"We propose the Hawkes flocking model that assesses systemic risk in high‐frequency processes at the two perspectives—endogeneity and interactivity. We examine the futures markets of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and gasoline for the past decade, and perform a comparative analysis with conditional value‐at‐risk as a benchmark measure. In terms of high‐frequency structure, we derive the empirical findings. The endogenous systemic risk in WTI was significantly higher than that in gasoline, and the level at which gasoline affects WTI was constantly higher than that in the opposite case. Moreover, although the relative influence's degree was asymmetric, its difference has gradually reduced."

It is obtained by doing perturbation theory around the exact analytical solution of a model which possesses a two‐dimensional Galilean symmetry. We compare our perturbative solution of the Merton–Garman model to Monte Carlo simulations and find that our solutions perform surprisingly well for a wide range of parameters. We also show how to use symmetries to build option pricing models. Our results demonstrate that the concept of symmetry is important in mathematical finance."
73,"BitMEX bitcoin derivatives: Price discovery, informational efficiency, and hedging effectiveness","Carol Alexander, Jaehyuk Choi, Heungju Park, Sungbin Sohn",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22050,"BitMEX is the largest unregulated bitcoin derivatives exchange, listing contracts suitable for leverage trading and hedging. Using minute‐by‐minute data, we examine its price discovery and hedging effectiveness. We find that BitMEX derivatives lead prices on major bitcoin spot exchanges. Bid–ask spreads, interexchange spreads, and relative trading volumes are important determinants of price discovery. Further analysis shows that BitMEX derivatives have positive net spillover effects, are informationally more efficient than bitcoin spot prices, and serve as effective hedges against spot price volatility. Our evidence suggests that regulators prioritize the investigation of the legitimacy of BitMEX and its contracts."

Jordan, Woo‐Baik Lee, Jong Won Park",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22056,"This study addresses the effects of program trade regulation during large market moves. To address this issue, we analyze the effect of sidecars (halts that only affect program trades) on trade imbalance using Korean intraday data. We find that sidecars, as currently designed to halt all program trades, are not effective at controlling trade imbalance around volatile markets. Resolution of trade imbalance is more effective when program trade is unrestricted. Program trade, at least a subset, provides liquidity when it is at a premium. We conclude that current sidecars should be more carefully crafted as some program trades are market stabilizing."

Key topics include the impact of equity option listings on the underlying stock market, option market efficiency, anomalies in equity option returns, option market microstructure, investors’ behavioral biases, option price discovery, and private information revealed in equity option markets. Some directions for future research include the determinants of equity option returns and the effect of algorithmic trading in option markets."
76,The externalities of credit default swaps on stock return synchronicity,"Ran Zhao, Lu Zhu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22045,"We examine the externality effect of customer firms’ credit default swap (CDS) trading on the stock price informativeness of supplier firms. Our empirical results show that firms with a high proportion of sales to CDS referenced customers tend to have more firm‐specific embedded information in their stock prices and thus higher stock price informativeness, which is associated with a lower level of stock return synchronicity. We provide new evidence of CDS trading externality on equity market information environments along the supply chain."
77,The time‐to‐maturity pattern of futures price sensitivity to news,"Hoang‐Long Phan, Ralf Zurbruegg",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22046,"This paper examines the effect time‐to‐maturity has on how sensitive futures prices are to news flows. Unscheduled daily news flows that relate to the underlying asset of a futures contract are related to the daily realized volatility of futures to calculate a price‐news sensitivity ratio. The observed pattern follows an inverted U‐shape relationship and has a bearing on whether the maturity effect will be noticeable in a futures contract. This paper also shows that by examining the peak‐to‐maturity of the price sensitivity to news pattern, it is possible to better identify which contracts are more likely to yield higher volatility."
78,Return dynamics during periods of high speculation in a thinly traded commodity market,"Martin T. Bohl, Martin Stefan",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fut.22063,"This article studies the effects of speculation in a thinly traded commodity futures market, paying particular attention to periods characterized by high‐speculative activity of long–short speculators. Using the speculation ratio as a daily measure for long–short speculation, we employ generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity regressions to study its impact on return dynamics. Our results for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange feeder cattle futures market suggest that futures returns are predominantly explained by fundamentals, but their volatility is significantly driven by the speculation ratio. This relationship holds for periods of high‐ and low‐speculative activity alike."
