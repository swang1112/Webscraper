1,Long‐term consequences of the 2020 coronavirus pandemics: Historical global‐macro context,Damir Tokic,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22448,"The COVID‐19 pandemics is likely to accelerate the trends of de‐globalization and de‐dollarization. Over the long term, the major financial consequence is likely to be the accelerated trend of rising inflation and long‐term interest rates. More broadly, the post‐pandemic environment will likely encompass difficult longer‐term economic and geopolitical challenges. Alternatively, the COVID‐19 pandemics also creates an opportunity for building a new trend of more sustainable globalization."
2,Do long‐term swap rate and stock price give an impact on Japanese Real Estate Investment Trust market under quantitative and qualitative easing and negative interest rate policy?,Takayasu Ito,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22431,"An increase in stock price has a positive impact on the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market, but an increase in interest rate has a negative impact on the REIT market in the regime of quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE). The wealth effect holds. As for the impact of interest rate, swap rate of 30 years is larger than that of 20 years in the period of QQE. On the other hand, all the negative coefficients of stock price are statistically significant at the 1% level in the period of negative interest rate policy (NIRP). But none of the negative coefficients of interest rate are significant even at the 10% level. This result is very rare in the analysis of REIT market not only in Japan, but also in other countries such as USA. Investors tend to buy REITs to compensate for the sluggish stock market and reduced gains in the fixed income market. When the Bank of Japan adopts QQE, normal function of REIT market is maintained. But after they introduce NIRP, normal function of REIT market is lost. This phenomenon is a negative effect of NIRP."
3,The next merger and acquisition hot spot in the Middle East (2009–2018): An Update,"Ali M. Metwalli, Jim P. Demello",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22442,"Mergers and acquisitions are being increasingly used by corporate managers, worldwide, to enter, develop, and enhance market share. Major economic, social, and political changes have taken place in various countries in the Middle East region during the past decade as a result of the global recession of 2008 and the Arab Spring of 2011 resulting in the implementation of policies fostering foreign direct investment, economic growth, and stability. Published research regarding the impact of these policies on business organizations, investment, trade, and competitive strategies is fairly sparse. This article provides an update regarding the merger and acquisition trends that have resulted in 19 countries of the Middle East, with a particular focus on Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Egypt."
4,Operating performance and long‐run stock returns following share repurchase: Evidence from an emerging market,"Huabing Barbara Wang, Cuong Nguyen, Ngoc Dinh",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22450,"This study examines the long‐term abnormal returns and operating performance following share repurchase announcements by Vietnamese listed firms. Applying matched control samples based on industry, exchange listing, size plus book‐to‐market, and pre‐event operating performance, we document significantly higher post‐repurchase buy‐and‐hold abnormal returns over the one‐year window. The outperformance becomes insignificant for most control samples with a longer horizon of 2 years after controlling for common pricing factors. Regarding operating performance, our results show improvement for repurchasing firms in the fiscal year concurrent with the repurchase announcements when we adopt the control sample based on pre‐event performance, but we do not find significant differences for the subsequent fiscal year. Examining the relation between the dual phenomena, we find some evidence of positive association in that firms with better post‐repurchase performance tend to have higher post‐event abnormal returns. This relation is stronger for firms with higher completion rates, consistent with the notion that actual repurchase is a stronger and more credible signal to the market."
5,"Portfolio strategy for managing R&D, royalties and transnational taxes",William V. Rapp,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22443,This article is based on a successful consulting project for a large Fortune 100 technology‐based US MNE facing various tax and royalty issues related to the use of its technology by its subsidiaries and affiliates and its licensing agreements with other companies in different countries.
6,Comparing different methods for the estimation of interbank intraday yield curves,"Vahidin Jeleskovic, Anastasios Demertzidis",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22438,"In this study, we compare three different models, namely, the Nelson–Siegel model (NSM), the Svensson model (SVM), and the Diebold–Li model (DLM), for the estimation of an intraday yield curve on the Italian interbank credit market e‐MID. Using a sample, which spans from October 2005 until March 2010, the first important finding is that all three models are highly suitable for the estimation of an intraday yield curve providing superior empirical results when compared with similar works on e‐MID. The second important finding is that, based on different in‐sample statistics, the SVM dominates the other two models before, during, and after the financial crisis from 2007. Moreover, the NSM seems to dominate the DLM although these differences in goodness‐of‐fit between these two models may not be statistically significant. Our findings are of high practical importance from different perspectives regarding interbank credit markets, including the better understanding of trading processes, the optimization of banks' trading strategies, and monetary policy implications. Finally, our findings can be seen as the starting point for further analyses in this research area."
7,Corporate environmental performance and stock market performance: Indian evidence on disaggregated measure of sustainability,"Vanita Tripathi, Juhi Jham",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22444,"The study addresses the emerging needs of green investing as it believes that the firms that are better equipped with mitigating and adapting climate change and its associated risk also perform better in the market. The construct of superior performance is based on the models linking environmental performance and financial performance in the literature. It aims to validate if those firms that are better equipped with adapting to climate change generate superior or equivalent market return as compared to blue chip firms, socially responsible firms, and general market portfolio. It further examines if market values disaggregated measure of sustainability, that is, environmental performance differently from others. Results of the study are consistent with the theoretical work suggesting that green investing is reflected in demand differences between green and nongreen stocks. It also establishes a link between alpha's and green investing. The results show that all green portfolios outperformed market at 1% significance level over 12‐year period and various subperiods. Results also indicate that investors of Indian stock market value pure green stocks more than those stocks that are screened out based on the criteria of corporate governance, employee relations, and other social factors along with environmental factor."
8,Studying the patterns and long‐run dynamics in cryptocurrency prices,Mathew Abraham,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22427,"This study analyses the price movements of a select sample of cryptocurrencies and examines whether they are cointegrated and predictable using machine learning algorithm and Johansen Test. The study used daily historical trading data of 76 cryptocurrencies sourced from different cryptocurrency exchanges. A sub‐sample of six cryptocurrencies were chosen for the cointegration and machine learning analysis based on their market share, attractiveness to the investors and availability of data for the full sample period. The data records starting from April 29, 2013 to February 7, 2019 were considered for the study. An error correction model was estimated to investigate both the long‐run and short‐run dynamics between the cryptocurrency prices. The evidence from the error correction model estimates shows that there is a long‐run association between the prices of crypto currencies. The machine learning algorithm involving neural networks (multilayer perception) was used to comprehend the data patterns in the cryptocurrency price series, and the results show that the model fits well in identifying and predicting the data patterns. The study also examines the possible value drivers of cryptocurrencies by estimating a linear regression with a set of covariates, which include the cryptocurrency demand and supply interaction variables and financial variables such as the NZX/S&P 50 index and exchange rates. The linear model estimates confirm that cryptocurrency market fundamentals have an important impact on cryptocurrency prices; however, they do not support the prediction that financial fundamentals are the major value drivers of cryptocurrencies."
9,Non‐GAAP earnings disclosure post 2010 SEC regulation change,"Theresa F. Henry, Rob R. Weitz, David A. Rosenthal",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22435,"In this article, we explore the disclosure of non‐GAAP earnings by large, publicly traded companies, and the possible impact of the 2010 change in Regulation G and S‐K on corporate reporting behavior. The reporting of non‐GAAP earnings measures is not required for public companies, nor are these measures audited. There exists considerable leeway in the manner and extent to which companies can report and calculate non‐Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings. Not surprisingly, non‐GAAP reporting standards are a concern for regulators trying to uphold the consistency and comparability of financial reporting. We collected the fourth quarter earnings releases of Standard and Poor's (S&P) 100 companies for the years 2010 through 2016 to study their reported annual non‐GAAP earnings disclosures, if any. Adjustments made to GAAP earnings were classified into eight common categories (e.g., Restructuring Charges, Tax Related Benefits/Charges) in order to calculate the magnitude, materiality, and nature of the adjustments reported. Our analysis shows that the number of companies reporting non‐GAAP earnings increased over our period of study, with a significant increase occurring after the 2010 liberalization of the Regulation G rules. We found an increase in all categories of adjustments and that most were −10% to +10% of net income. The median values of adjustments were positive in almost all the categories indicating non‐GAAP adjustments generally increase non‐GAAP net earnings. We observed many instances of companies reporting the same category of non‐GAAP earnings over multiple years. Further, we find that companies that do not report non‐GAAP earnings have higher market capitalizations than non‐GAAP earnings reporters. This study contributes to the research of non‐GAAP earnings reporting with an extensive analysis of the disclosure, the nature and magnitude of adjustments companies report, and the characteristics of those companies that choose to disclose."
10,Dividend announcements signaling role in financial reporting certification,"Sagi Akron, Ronen Barak, Roi D. Taussig",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22439,"This paper demonstrates a crucial signaling role for dividend announcements in the certification of corporate financial reporting. In light of the great financial reporting scandals of the 2000s, we adjust a price‐diffusion model to asymmetric information friction, such that first‐stage unexpected earnings announcements are conditionally absorbed by the market, depending on the corporate governance—level of the firm's transparency. In the second stage, the firm undertakes a complement dividend announcement‐signaling act, certifying the first‐stage earnings surprise announcement, in light of the firm's transparency. We conjecture theoretically and confirm empirically that the dividend announcement's cumulative abnormal return (CAR) is negatively and statistically significant, depending on the interaction between the unexpected earnings announcement's magnitude and the corporate transparency level. Hence, the study demonstrates a key role of dividend announcement, signaling the market about the initial financial reporting credibility. Specifically, low transparency level firms are incentivized to certify their preliminary financial reporting by dividend announcements, to alleviate the market hesitant absorption of their positive earnings surprise."
11,Employee stock ownership and cost of capital: Evidence from the S&P 500,"Domenico Campa, Alexander Kern",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22449,"This article investigates whether the presence of employee stock ownership (ESO) is associated with a firm's cost of capital. Based on all of the S&P 500 firms, we find that ESO decreases the overall cost of capital in entities by reducing their cost of debt. In contrast, we find no strong relationship between ESO and the cost of equity. We also show that ESO provides a company with immunity to changes in the cost of capital observed during financial crises. We conclude that external providers of funds associate ESO with a lower financial risk, and that equity investors balance the positive effects of ESO, such as increased employee motivation and commitment, with the negative effects arising from management entrenchment and dilution in property rights. Overall, we show that ESO reduces a firm's perceived financial risk. Our results also encourage managers to involve their employees in the life of the business by granting them company shares."
12,The persistence of current market valuation of future capital investment,Nancy Beneda,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22445,"This paper examines the valuation of future potential capital spending and research and development expense (capital investment) in current market value of equity. The purpose of this study is to develop an option modelling technique which can be used by financial analysts to assist in measuring the current market value of future new capital spending and the persistence of the value of capital investment. A capital investment Delta is developed, using option pricing modelling, as an indicator of productive future capital investment. This study uses a sample of initial public offerings (IPOs), which went public during the years, 2004 through 2015. The metrics are computed at the end of the second year after going public and then regressed on the next year NASDAQ adjusted stock return. The results of the study indicate that productive future capital investment, as developed in the current study, is persistent and is significantly associated with a firm's future stock performance."
13,Audit quality and audit size: Evidence from auditor mergers in China,"Jun Zhan, Young‐Won Her, Keji Chen",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22447,"Focusing on the surge of mergers among Chinese local accounting firms around the year 2000, this study examines the impacts of auditor mergers on audit quality, and documents increased earnings quality for non‐Big 5 clients during the postmerger period. The study also brings up the question for further investigation, whether the Big 5 auditors provide significant higher quality audits than the non‐Big auditors do in China, a far less litigious audit market environment, during the period of 1999–2002. We find limited differences in terms of audit quality between the Big 5 and non‐Big 5 auditors. We do not find significant differences in reported discretionary accruals and probability of reporting losses between Big 5 clients and non‐Big 5 clients. Only with the earnings conservatism proxy, clients with Big 5 recognize bad news more quickly than non‐Big 5 clients. Furthermore, findings of this study suggest the Big 5 audits do not contribute to the accruals quality differences in China, implying legal enforcement and litigation risks have greater propensity to drive auditor incentives."
14,Artificial intelligence in accounting: GAAP's “FAS133”,Louis P. Le Guyader,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22407,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the necessary element to ensure that the most complex modern accounting rules are implemented correctly. This is particularly true when accounting interacts with increasingly sophisticated capital markets activities. The last 20 years' of accounting rulemaking and the dictates of regulators have ensured a need for AI. With user‐friendly AI solutions, reporting entities will not shy away from business practices because they fear they cannot account for them correctly. AI will remain an opportunity and challenge to the accounting profession."
15,The European Union's endorsement of Amendments to International Financial Reporting Standard 4: An unprecedented “top up”,Michael Dobler,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22436,"The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) must pass a formal endorsement process to become binding for companies based in the European Union (EU). In an unparalleled instance, the EU recently endorsed “Amendments to IFRS 4” with a modification labeled as “top up” by allowing European financial conglomerates to defer the application of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” in their insurance sectors. This paper explains the background of this decision, identifies the “top up” as an unprecedented case of carve‐in, and discusses the key implications for regulation and practice."

18,Blockchain distributed ledger technology: An introduction and focus on smart contracts,Marc Hamilton,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22421,"The rapid evolution of the blockchain and distributed ledger technology and the associated applications will require many changes in the way business is transacted and how transactions are recorded. Significant R&D investments in blockchain environments and the maturation of application uses of “smart contracts” and other types of self‐executing tools are establishing frameworks for expanded use, infrastructure growth, and further development. The realization of the impact of these investments is currently changing entire business processes, transforming industries, and impacting governments globally. This global disruptive impact is a major technology evolution and will be transformational to society over the next several decades much as the Internet has been over the last 30 years. As these changes will be especially transformational to fundamental accounting processes, tools, and methodologies of today, accounting and finance professionals would be wise to embrace the technological challenges associated with blockchain technology."
19,The new management of recordkeeping,Reina G. Wiatt,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22426,"This article focuses on the emerging applications of blockchain technology for recordkeeping and data management requirements. Blockchain—the technology supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—is a shared ledger that maintains transactions and documents in digital form. In a time when businesses face challenges in managing data security, there is a compelling case for developing a digital‐based recordkeeping system to address social problems on a global scale. Improving food supply chain safety, reducing the conflict diamond trade, and assisting refugees in preserving identity and academic credential records are just a few of the solutions offered by blockchains. Our global economy depends on the ability to create, store, and share accurate records. While implementation challenges remain, blockchain technology's ability to store and distribute immutable documents has the potential to improve data management security for industries worldwide."
20,Blockchain adoption is inevitable—Barriers and risks remain,"Kyleen W. Prewett, Gregory L. Prescott, Kirk Phillips",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22415,"Blockchain technology possesses a vast potential to transform traditional business models. Savvy business executives are already exploring how blockchain might impact their industries and their competitive positions within those industries. Yet, there are significant barriers and risks associated with blockchain technology. In this article, we highlight some of the major obstacles and risks associated with this transformative technology. The topics discussed here are neither definitive nor comprehensive; however, they provide accounting and finance professionals with a timely introduction to the barriers and perils related to blockchain technology. Although blockchain adoption is inevitable for business enterprises, careful consideration of the risks and challenges before, during, and after blockchain implementation will help ensure long‐term success."
21,Blockchain consortium networks: Adding security and trust in financial services,"Julia Nathan, Bob Jacobs",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22428,"This article explores blockchain consortium networks as an emerging technology for financial institutions. Blockchain is quickly becoming recognized for its value as an immutable ledger within the financial services industry. While Blockchain provides direct benefits in fraud prevention and transaction efficiency, consortium networks specifically address a need for increased trust and security in shared business processes. Also discussed are strategic decisions needed for implementing blockchain consortium networks at the enterprise level with topics ranging from membership choices to use of cloud services."
22,Should accountants care about blockchain?,"Stephen H. Fuller, Ariel Markelevich",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22424,"The use of blockchain technology has increased tremendously over the last decade. Blockchain continues to evolve and new features and capabilities are developed continuously. Although the use of the technology started in cryptocurrency (specifically, Bitcoin), it has expanded to other areas that can benefit from a shared, secure, ledger. This article investigates the potential impact of blockchain technology on the accounting profession. This article analyzes data security and privacy considerations, technology, adoption, and implementation considerations, and some considerations that relate specifically to accounting and auditing. We find that the unique needs of an accounting information system may not be a good match for blockchain as it currently exists. While we explain that blockchain may deliver many benefits, particularly in the areas of data reliability and the financial statement audit, we identify several factors, which raise significant questions about whether blockchain will ever be significantly integrated in the accounting function. Chief among those concerns is the scalability of the technology at an acceptable cost. While significant investment has and will be made for further development of blockchain business applications, it is our assessment that proponents of blockchain integration in accounting have not yet made the economic case for it. We also have significant concerns about whether blockchain technology can adequately address risks associated with data security and privacy. Addressing all these issues will be a minimum requirement for gaining widespread acceptance by firms and their accountants."
23,Blockchain security risk assessment and the auditor,"Barbara S. White, Chula G. King, Jonathon Holladay",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22433,"A blockchain is an Internet‐based peer‐to‐peer system that forms a network of independent and connected computers that simultaneously record and verify transactions. This peer‐to‐peer system focuses on who owns the information and how that information is transferred. Blockchains offer significant advantages over traditional databases where users can delete, modify, and change records. The advantages include improved efficiencies, lower costs, enhanced transparency, and an immutable audit history of all transactions. The advantages, however, are not without significant risks. The risks include technological risks, data security risks, interoperability risks, and third‐party vendor risks. Because of the inherent advantages in blockchains, auditors are being called upon to provide assurance services to clients who use blockchains and to advise clients on blockchain technology. Therefore, auditors must be equipped with the knowledge and expertise of not only blockchain technology, but also the assessment of risks inherent in blockchain technology."

25,Blockchain—Opportunities and challenges for accounting professionals,Soma Sinha,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22430,"Everybody is talking about blockchain, which is being positioned as the solution for all business ills. Blockchain is a revolutionary technology, but its power and efficacy are only as good as its application. Blockchain has the potential to transform or even eliminate some of the accounting functions that are currently taken for granted, but it also creates risks of its own that must be considered. The technology is still in its formative stage and is certain to undergo meaningful changes in the future. Entities using this technology will have to weigh its benefits, but also build safeguards to protect against its vulnerabilities."
26,Asset tokenization in plain English,George Sazandrishvili,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22432,"Asset tokenization is an expansion of blockchain technology that allows digital assets to be bought, sold, and traded on blockchains. Digitizing real assets will help create universally accessible, fast, liquid, and transparent investment and financial systems. However, blockchain and related asset tokenization are still in their infancy, and there are obstacles that need to be overcome before widespread adoption occurs. This article describes what it means to tokenize an asset on a blockchain, how tokenization is accomplished, and why it has the potential to disrupt a variety of industries, particularly the financial and real estate industries. Challenges that are associated with implementing asset tokenization are also explored."

28,The passive investment bubble,Damir Tokic,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22437,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, investors have significantly increased their allocation to passive investment vehicles, such as the exchange traded funds. At the same time, the active investment funds experienced significant outflows as their performance underperformed the major indices. As the result of these capital flows, the market participation balance potentially changed, which increased the possibility of a market bubble—which some already define as the passive investment bubble."
29,Long‐term interest rates under negative interest rate policy: Analysis of Japanese government bond and swap markets,Takayasu Ito,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22410,"Market segmentation is observed in the Japanese government bond (JGB) and swap markets of 2‐, 3‐, 4‐, 5‐, 7‐, and 10‐year maturities under negative interest rate policy regime. This also means that the arbitrage between the JGB and swap markets does not work in these maturities. After the Bank of Japan introduces a yield curve control policy under negative interest rate policy, market segmentation is observed only in the JGB and swap markets of 7‐ and 10‐year maturities. In the maturities of 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, the JGB yield and the swap rate co‐move. The market function recovers and arbitrage works between the JGB and swap markets in these maturities."
30,Democracy and tax avoidance: An international study,"Jiameng Ma, Kai Guo, Jiemin Yu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22416,"We examine the impact of home country democracy on corporate tax avoidance. Specifically, we investigate how two aspects of democracy (political freedom and electoral democracy) are associated with corporate tax avoidance, respectively. Political freedom reduces tax avoidance, as public scrutiny increases financial transparency risk of tax avoidance and participation in political decision‐making process raises willingness to pay taxes. Electoral democracy increases tax avoidance, as election increases tax system complexity which in turn increases tax avoidance. Furthermore, we find that corruption control and social stability strengthen the negative association between political freedom and tax avoidance. Corporate tax complexity as percentage of overall tax complexity strengthens the positive association between electoral democracy and tax avoidance. Additional tests show shareholder protection and being a common law country weaken the negative association between political freedom and tax avoidance, and strengthen the positive association between electoral democracy and tax avoidance. Robustness checks using colony history as instrumental variable confirm the results."
31,"Corporate social responsibility and bankruptcy probability: Exploring the role of market competition, intellectual capital, and equity cost","Hashem Kamalirezaei, Ali Asghar Anvary Rostamy, Ali Saeedi, Mohammad Khodaei Valeh Zaghard",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22417,"This research investigates the relationship between corporate social responsibility and the probability of bankruptcy and explains the moderating role of the structure of market competition, intellectual capital, and equity cost on this relationship. Using a sample of the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2009–2016, panel data, and logit‐ranking model, we find an inverse relationship between corporate social responsibility and the probability of bankruptcy. Results from additional analyses show that corporate social responsibility has a significant inverse relationship with the probability of bankruptcy and when the market structure moves to a monopoly, the probability of bankruptcy is reduced due to high market entry costs for other companies. Overall, we document that corporate social responsibility plays an important roles in reducing the probability of bankruptcy of companies."
32,Does financial crisis impact earnings management? Evidence from Turkey,Nida Türegün,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22418,"This study attempts to display the impact of global financial crisis of 2008 on earnings management (EM) compare with the period before and after with the case of listed manufacturing firms in Borsa Istanbul for the period of 2007–2012. Furthermore, it deepens the EM literature by concentrating on an emerging economy. Discretionary accruals (DA) were computed using the modified Jones model as a measure of EM. Moreover, this study examines EM behavior by separating firms into firms with positive and negative DA. The results of this study registered a high level of EM in firms throughout the postcrisis period."
33,"Annual reporting, agency costs, and firm valuations","Igor Semenenko, Junwook Yoo",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22419,"Shareholder valuations are economically significantly and statistically negatively correlated with the length of 10 K filings or their digital file sizes, whereas annual reports posted on corporate websites are uninformative. Firms with longer 10 K filings are likely to experience slower growth, lower profitability, experience free cash flow problems, and write off goodwill and intangible assets from past acquisitions. Lengthy filings are more damaging than suggested by three‐year performance following report filing dates, suggesting that outside investors penalize firms for information asymmetries and associated agency costs. Full disclosure is best from the standpoint of long‐term shareholder wealth, but managers could be maximizing short‐term term returns that better match their investment horizons."
34,Investigation of enterprise value using information transparency: The case of optoelectronic industry,"Tzu‐Yi Yang, Chin‐Mei Chou, Yu‐Tai Yang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22420,"The corporate information given to the investors is insufficient if it is only financial information, and thus, it should include other nonfinancial information, such as relations with the investors, to let the general public accurately understand the situation of how the enterprise creates its value, the process of corporate transparency. Therefore, this research discusses the relationship between information transparency and enterprise value (EV) in stock‐listed companies in the optoelectronic industry that is one of the key industries in Taiwan, and using unbalanced panel random‐effects regression investigates 72 listed firms in the optoelectronic industry. Determining information transparency has a significant influence on EV."
35,Hiring “tainted” outside directors on the board,Soohyung Kim,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22425,"By looking at the unique data set during the period from 2011 to 2015, this research presents evidence that a firm's decision to hire a tainted outside director (OD) onto its board produces significantly improved firm performance. I defined tainted ODs as ODs that are (were) senior executives at other firms where class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of an investor group that had suffered a financial loss in a stock. Especially, for the firms that appointed tainted OD as the chair of audit committee, their industry‐adjusted return on assets is significantly increased by 6.8%. These results mean that under the presence of career concerns theory, tainted OD's history directly related to a previous securities class action lawsuit is a unique experience that modifies and disciplines their future behavior and eventually helps improve firm performance. Thus, through appointing tainted OD as an audit committee chair the firm might be able to reinforce the monitoring and transparency of its board, resulting in significantly better firm performance than any other control firms."
36,"Internal audit standard compliance, potentially competing duties, and external auditors' reliance decision","David Breger, Mark Edmonds, Marc Ortegren",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22434,"This article explores the impact of two previously overlooked characteristics, compliance with Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards and the presence of potentially competing duties, on external auditors' perceptions of internal audit competence, objectivity, and, in turn, their willingness to rely on the internal audit function. This research finds that external auditors consider internal audit functions to be more competent and objective when they fully comply with IIA standards and that external auditors consider internal auditors to be more objective in the absence of any potentially competing duties in other areas. Overall, ratings of objectivity and competence relate to the decision to rely on the internal audit function. This study contributes by providing evidence that external auditors are more willing to rely on internal audit functions that comply with IIA standards and do not perform managerial/consulting duties, even though evidence suggests internal audit functions often do not fully comply with IIA standards and do perform managerial/consulting duties. Additionally, this study's results suggest that remedial action could reduce external audit fees and improve internal audit quality."
37,Exploring the difference between implied volatilities of options embedded in convertible bonds and exchange‐traded options and its contributing factors,"Tanawit Sae‐Sue, Supawut Sinthawat, Narapong Srivisal",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcaf.22429,"The convertible feature attached to a newly issued bond represents an embedded option whose value is determined by firm. The embedded option's implied volatility reflects the firm's view of its stock price risk which may differ from that of the market reflected in the exchange‐traded option. If such a gap in implied volatilities exists, it may create arbitrage opportunity for investors. Hence, we determined the gap between the implied volatilities extracted from the U.S. exchange‐traded option and embedded option and investigated its potential contributing factors, including corporate variables (price‐to‐book, market capitalization, cost of debt, debt‐to‐equity) and bond variables (maturity, default probability). The result showed that, during 2014–2016, the difference existed and was attributed to the firm's market capitalization. Our finding suggests the potential arbitrage opportunity in the debt, equity, and convertible instruments of small market capitalization firms."
