1,Term structure determinants of time‐varying risk of 1‐year bond returns,Revansiddha Basavaraj Khanapure,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12222,"Term structure drivers of 1‐year bond premia and conditional bond return risk are distinct. Consequently, the Cochrane–Piazzesi factor captures aggregate price of risk and not the amount of risk in 1‐year bond returns. One linear combination of forward rates captures most of the variation in bond return risk across maturities. Interest rate level captures substantial amount of variation in the conditional return risk, a finding consistent with rising inflation uncertainty with level of inflation and interest rates. The 4‐5 yield spread, an important positive predictor of bond return premia, has an opposing but limited impact on the conditional volatility."
2,Trade signing in fast markets,"Allen Carrion, Madhuparna Kolay",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12218,"This study assesses the accuracy of trade signing algorithms in fast trading environments using NASDAQ and NYSE trade and quote data. Using data that contain true trade signs, we show that the Lee and Ready algorithm outperforms the tick rule and classifies trades at least as well as in earlier studies from slower trading environments, even in subsamples where the market is particularly fast. We conclude that trade signing remains viable in fast markets, and that the use of quote data continues to increase trade classification accuracy."
3,Capturing hedge fund risk factor exposures: Hedge fund return replication with ETFs,"Jun Duanmu, Yongjia Li, Alexey Malakhov",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12221,"We develop a new factor selection methodology of spanning the space of hedge fund risk factors with all available exchange traded funds (ETFs). We demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology with out‐of‐sample individual hedge fund return replication by ETF clone portfolios. This is consistent with our interpretation of ETF returns as proxies to risk factors driving hedge fund returns. We further consider portfolios of “cloneable” and “noncloneable” hedge funds, defined as top and bottom in‐sample R2 matches, and demonstrate that our ETF clone portfolios slightly outperform cloneable hedge funds out of sample."
4,Religion and venture investing: A cross‐country analysis,"Min Maung, Zhenyang Tang, Xiaowei Xu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12233,"Using a sample of 56 countries over the 2000–2016 period, we document lower levels of venture capital investments in more religious countries. These results are not specific to any primary religion. Furthermore, we show that the negative relation between religiosity and venture investing mainly stems from risk aversion inherent in religiosity. Our results are unlikely driven by economic clout, as we show more religious countries in fact have higher levels of domestic credit or nonfinancial investments, despite lower levels of venture investments. We also present several findings consistent with risk aversion. Venture investments in more religious countries are more likely to have successful exits and are less likely to be foreign or early‐stage deals. Our results are robust to different measures of venture investments and religiosity, and to alternative specifications that account for endogeneity."
5,Stock market anomalies and baseball cards,"Joseph Engelberg, Linh Thompson, Jared Williams",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12223,"Baseball cards exhibit anomalies that are analogous to those that are documented in financial markets, namely, momentum, price drift in the direction of past fundamental performance, and initial public offering (IPO) underperformance. Momentum is higher among active players than retired players, and among newer sets than older sets. Regarding IPO underperformance, we find that newly issued rookie cards underperform newly issued cards of veteran players, and that newly issued sets underperform older sets. The results are broadly consistent with models of slow information diffusion and short‐selling constraints."
6,Commonality in liquidity and multilateral trading facilities,"Pankaj K. Jain, Mohamed Mekhaimer, Sandra Mortal",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12225,"We use the introduction of two multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) to examine the impact of market fragmentation on commonality in liquidity. We find that the introduction of MTFs following the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive increases the comovement of stocks’ liquidity with MTF liquidity, while the comovement with the home market liquidity generally decreases. We also find that the higher the MTF trading volume or the number of MTFs trading a stock, the stronger the effect. Further, we find that the commonality in liquidity remains unchanged for a matched control sample of stocks that do not trade on MTFs."
7,"Time‐varying risk of rare disasters, investment, and asset pricing","Bo Liu, Yingjie Niu, Jinqiang Yang, Zhentao Zou",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12226,"We extend an equilibrium business cycle/asset pricing model of production and capital accumulation by introducing a time‐varying risk of rare disasters. It predicts that investment is much more volatile than output, which provides theoretical support for the empirical data. Furthermore, the model‐generated stationary distribution of the investment‐output ratio fits the data remarkably well. Both of them exhibit negative skewness, which means that there is a small probability that this ratio can be very low. Given the observations of the investment‐output ratio, we obtain the values of the jump intensity implicit in the historical data and find those recession periods coincide with a rapid increase in the probability of a disaster. Finally, the model shows that the existence of adjustment costs generates a procyclical price of capital and contributes to resolving the equity premium puzzle."

9,Wealth transfer through private placements: Evidence from China,"Jing Lin, Steven X. Zheng, Mingshan Zhou",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12215,"We examine private issuance of public equity (PIPE) in China, and our results suggest that PIPE investors benefit from the price manipulation before and after issuance. These investors tend to cash out after lockup expiration and make large profits. We also find evidence that the trading of PIPE investors after lockup expiration is informed. Tests about the abnormal returns in the 3 years after lockup expiration suggest that at least part of the benefits PIPE investors receive come from wealth transfer from outside investors. Overall, PIPE issuers in China seem to use an opaque mechanism to compensate PIPE investors."
10,The local market perception of firm risks during cross‐listing events,"Kathryn Schumann‐Foster, Elias Semaan, Hui Sono",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12204,"We examine the local investors’ perceptions on the relative idiosyncratic risks around cross‐listing events. We find that increases in relative firm‐specific risks around the listing date are temporary and small for Level I American depositary receipts (ADRs) while Level III ADRs have the most variations. For exchange‐listed ADRs from emerging markets, there is a significant decrease in the relative firm‐specific risk in the year prior to listing, which increases during the cross‐listing, while there are only significant increases in relative firm‐specific risks for developed market firms. We interpret these as evidences of negative relationship between firm opaqueness and relative firm‐specific risks."
11,Does local political support influence financial markets? A study on the impact of job approval ratings of political representatives on local stock returns,"Sunghoon Joo, Dong H. Kim, Jung Chul Park",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12211,"Using data on job approval ratings of governors, U.S. senators, and the president, we find that firms located in states with high approval ratings outperform firms located in states with low approval ratings by .64% per month. Furthermore, this relationship is stronger when investors are actively involved in politics, when local politicians are closer to the center of political power, for small firms that have a larger proportion of local investors, and for financially strong areas where investors are ready to execute investments in local stocks. Overall, our study shows that investors’ political sentiment is important in determining stock returns."
12,State ownership and banks’ information rents: Evidence from China,"Fengyan Yu, Qi Liang, Wei Wang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12197,"In a lending relationship, a bank with an information advantage regarding its client tends to hold up the borrower and charge higher interest rates. We conjecture that state‐owned enterprises (SOEs), with worse information asymmetry, are subject to greater information rents. State‐owned banks place less emphasis on information production and hence extract lower rents compared to profit‐maximizing private banks. We use the decline of loan interest rates around the borrowers’ equity initial public offerings (IPOs) as the proxy of banks’ information rents. We find SOEs in China experience larger declines in loan interest rates around their IPOs; the central government‐controlled Big Four banks exhibit smaller declines in rates they charge, and their rate declines concentrate on loans made to SOEs."
13,Corporate decision making in the presence of political uncertainty: The case of corporate cash holdings,"William B. Hankins, Anna‐Leigh Stone, Chak Hung Jack Cheng, Ching‐Wai (Jeremy) Chiu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12205,"Using a quarterly panel of U.S. corporations over the period 1985–2014, we show that corporate managers respond to political uncertainty and economic policy uncertainty shocks in different ways. We proxy for political uncertainty using the Partisan Conflict Index and employ a prevalent empirical macroeconomic methodology to construct structural shocks that are orthogonal to shocks captured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index. Following a political uncertainty shock, corporations increase cash but do not adjust investment. Alternatively, following an economic policy uncertainty shock, firms appear to draw on cash and reduce capital spending to increase research and development spending."
14,Capital market frictions and human capital investment: Evidence from workplace safety around regulation SHO,"John (Jianqiu) Bai, Eunju Lee, Chi Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12227,"This paper examines the effect of capital market frictions on firms’ workplace safety. Using Regulation SHO as a natural experiment, we find a significant increase in work‐related injury rates of pilot firms. The effect is stronger for firms in more competitive industries and with high financial constraints, and weaker for firms whose employees have high negotiating power and with good corporate governance. Further tests suggest that managers’ myopia shifts their focus away from investments in workplace safety when workplace safety is not related to firm performance. Overall, the results highlight how capital market frictions affect firms’ investment in human capital."

17,Fifty years of The Financial Review: A bibliometric overview,"H. Kent Baker, Satish Kumar, Debidutta Pattnaik",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12228,"The Financial Review (FR) is a highly regarded journal publishing original empirical, theoretical, and methodological research in all areas of financial economics. It celebrated its golden jubilee year in 2018. Using bibliometric techniques, we analyze the journal's impact, prominent topics, most prolific authors, and their affiliated institutions and countries. Our analysis also identifies the most often cited articles at different points in the journal's history. Using textual data analytics, we identify the most frequent themes discussed between 1969 and 2018 by decade."
18,Managerial effect or firm effect: Evidence from the private debt market,"Bill B. Francis, Iftekhar Hasan, Yun Zhu",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12196,"This paper provides evidence that the managerial effect is a key determinant of firms’ cost of capital, in the context of private debt contracting. Applying the novel empirical method developed by an earlier study to a large sample that tracks the job movement of top managers, we find that the managerial effect is a critical and significant factor that explains a large part of the variation in loan contract terms more accurately than firm fixed effects. Additional evidence shows that banks “follow” managers when they change jobs and offer loan contracts with preferential terms to their new firms."
19,The syndicate structure of securitized corporate loans,"Zhengfeng Guo, Shage Zhang",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12203,"Securitized loans have lower lead bank shares, but larger shares held by non‐CLO (collateralized loan obligation) institutional investors than nonsecuritized loans. The result can largely be explained by their degree of information asymmetry and credit risk. We find that lead banks increase their holdings after a nonsecuritized loan becomes securitized, but they do not reduce financial exposure to securitized facilities during the boom of the CLO market. Furthermore, we find that securitized loans do not perform differently from similar nonsecuritized loans. We conclude that differences in syndicate structure are likely shaped by participants’ investment preference rather than a manifestation of adverse selection."
20,Officers’ fiduciary duties and acquisition outcomes,Syed Walid Reza,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12194,"Using a Delaware case law that recognized officers’ distinct fiduciary duties for the first time in 2009, I examine the effect of officers' fiduciary duties (OFDs) on corporate acquisitions. I find that firms with entrenched officers prior to 2009 experienced increased announcement‐period abnormal stock returns, mainly because their acquisitions created more synergies and reduced officers’ incentives to preserve control. These firms increased liability insurance premium expenditures, but reduced value‐decreasing acquisition frequencies. Furthermore, the effect of OFDs is more pronounced in firms where officers are not directors, have wealth risk, face less product market competition, are insulated from the market for corporate control, or are able to avoid board monitoring. Overall, OFDs are a critical corporate governance mechanism that works in tandem with other disciplinary mechanisms."
21,Too much liquidity? Seemingly excess cash for innovative firms,"Zhaozhao He, Stephen Ciccone",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12210,"We show that more cash allows innovative firms facing financing constraints to undertake more research and development projects and that this phenomenon has been more pronounced since 1980. In contrast to the secular increase in the level of cash holdings, average excess cash has not increased appreciably. We analyze excess cash disposition and document a strong relation between excess cash and research and development spending. Finally, our results suggest that increased difficulty in valuing research and development might be a source of financing frictions. These findings imply that “seemingly excess cash” has played an increasingly important role in mitigating underinvestment in innovation."
22,Not all threats are taken equally: Evidence from proxy fights,"Fang Chen, Lijing Du, Susan M. V. Flaherty, Jian Huang, Gokhan Torna",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12220,"Previous research shows that activist threats lead to corporate policy concessions. We find that the threat of proxy fights is responded to differently based on its credibility. Decomposing proxy fight threats, we find that only credible threats are associated with more leveraged, more innovative, and less acquisitive corporate policies. Management, however, does not respond to noncredible threats. Further, for materialized fights, the market reaction at announcement is also conditional on the credibility of the threats. Overall, not all activist threats are responded to equally by management or the market, and only credible threats achieve disciplinary effects and favorable valuation."
23,Local corporate misconduct and local initial public offerings,"Emre Kuvvet, Darshana D. Palkar",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12199,"This paper investigates the cost of going public through initial public offerings (IPOs) for firms located in regions with significant fraud density. We find that companies in regions with a high proportion of nearby firms that have committed corporate misconduct have more pronounced underpricing, experience higher post‐IPO stock return volatility, and are more likely to withdraw their offerings. Overall, our results show that local corporate misconduct is associated with the pricing of IPOs, and the breach of trust is related to costly IPOs for newcomers."
